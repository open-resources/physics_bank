## Question Text

How far to the right of the centre of the first stack is the centre of mass of this collection of pennies? Give your answer in terms of $d$.
Don't worry about the vertical position of the centre of mass, just give the horizontal position.

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in terms of $d$ (if your answer is 50$d$, then just enter 50 in the box).
