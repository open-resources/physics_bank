      title: Rolling without slipping
      name: Maya
    part1:
      ans1:
        value: The hoop, because it has less rotational intera, less of its total
          energy will be taken up by the rotation kinetic energy and more will remain
          for the translational kinetic energy (so it travels faster
      ans2:
        value: The sphere, because it has less rotational inertia, less of its total
          energy will be taken up by the rotation kinetic energy and more will remain
          for the translational kinetic energy (so it travels faster
      ans3:
        value: They both reach the bottom at the same time, because gravity causes
          all things to have the same acceleration regardless of their mass.
      ans4:
        value: There is not enough information to answer this question.

# {{ params.vars.title }}
Suppose {{ params.vars.name }} has a sphere (made of solid wood), and a hoop made of heavy metal; and both have the SAME MASS, and both have the SAME RADIUS.
{{ params.vars.name }} decides to race the two of them, and let them roll from rest down a flat ramp.

## Part 1

Which one of them will reach the bottom first?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part1.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans4.value }}
