    params_vars_title: Rolling without slipping
    params_vars_name: Emilia
    params_part1_ans1_value: The hoop, because it has less rotational intera, less
      of its total energy will be taken up by the rotation kinetic energy and more
      will remain for the translational kinetic energy (so it travels faster
    params_part1_ans2_value: The sphere, because it has less rotational inertia, less
      of its total energy will be taken up by the rotation kinetic energy and more
      will remain for the translational kinetic energy (so it travels faster
    params_part1_ans3_value: They both reach the bottom at the same time, because
      gravity causes all things to have the same acceleration regardless of their
      mass.
    params_part1_ans4_value: There is not enough information to answer this question.

# {{ params_vars_title }}
Suppose {{ params_vars_name }} has a sphere (made of solid wood), and a hoop made of heavy metal; and both have the SAME MASS, and both have the SAME RADIUS.
{{ params_vars_name }} decides to race the two of them, and let them roll from rest down a flat ramp.

## Part 1

Which one of them will reach the bottom first?

### Answer Section

- {{ params_part1_ans1_value }}
- {{ params_part1_ans2_value }}
- {{ params_part1_ans3_value }}
- {{ params_part1_ans4_value }}
