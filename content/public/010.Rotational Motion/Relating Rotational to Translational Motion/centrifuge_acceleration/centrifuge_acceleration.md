# {{ params.vars.title }}
The test tubes of high-speed centrifuges should be placed with care because of the very large acceleration.

## Part 1

Assume the centrifuge is rotating at {{params.v}} $\rm{rpm}$. Determine the acceleration at the end of a test tube that is placed {{params.r}} $\rm{cm}$ from the axis of rotation.

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value.

## Part 2

If this centrifuge stops after {{params.t}} $\rm{s}$, what is its angular acceleration?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value.
