# {{ params.vars.title }}
The world record for the women's "hammer" throw is held by Anita Wlodarczyk, who threw the {{params.m}} $\rm{kg}$ ball a distance of {{params.d}} $\rm{m}$. To perform this throw, Anita swung the ball from a {{params.r}} $\rm{m}$ steel wire. Assuming she accelerated the ball from rest while making {{params.rot}} rotations with constant angular acceleration, answer the following questions.

## Part 1

At the instant the ball was released, if it had a speed of {{params.v}} $\rm{m/s}$, what was its velocity?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value.

## Part 2

Just before the ball was released, what was its centripetal acceleration?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value.

## Part 3

Express the angular displacement of the ball while it was in circular motion in terms of $\pi$ radians.

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value.

## Part 4

Using rotational kinematics equations and your answers to Part 1 and Part 3, solve for the magnitude of the angular acceleration.

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value.

## Part 5

Solve for the tangential acceleration of the ball while it was in circular motion.

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value.

## Part 6

Solve for the magnitude of the total acceleration of the ball just before it was released.

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value.

## Part 7

Just after the ball was released, what was the magnitude of the ball's acceleration? Please answer to one decimal place.

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value.
