    params_part1_ans1_value: Increasing their moment of inertia, slowing down their
      angular velocity.
    params_part1_ans1_feedback: Great job! You got it!
    params_part1_ans2_value: Decreasing their moment of inertia, slowing down their
      angular velocity.
    params_part1_ans2_feedback: Consider if angular momentum is conserved.
    params_part1_ans3_value: Increasing their moment of inertia, speeding up their
      angular velocity.
    params_part1_ans3_feedback: Consider if angular momentum is conserved.
    params_part1_ans4_value: Decreasing their moment of inertia, speeding up their
      angular velocity.
    params_part1_ans4_feedback: Does spreading mass out from your centre of gravity
      increase or decrease your moment of inertia?
    params_part1_ans5_value: Showing the judges that they are in control, boosting
      their confidence.
    params_part1_ans5_feedback: Perhaps! But there is another more concrete reason.

## Part 1

When landing a triple axel (a figure skating jump where the skater rotates 3.5 times in the air before landing backwards), figure skaters often throw their arms and the leg they are not landing on far from their centre of gravity. This helps the skater land by:
