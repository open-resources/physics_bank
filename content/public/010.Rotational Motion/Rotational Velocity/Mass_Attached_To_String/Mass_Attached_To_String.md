# {{ params.vars.title }}
The figure below shows a mass attached to a string.
The mass is being swung in a horizontal circle in the counter - clockwise direction when the string is suddenly cut by a pair of scissors.

<img src="Q9.png" alt="The image depicts the circle with the mass attached swinging in a clockwise motion. The string is being cut when mass is a spot that is equivalent to 5 o'clock. Choice A shows that the trajectory of the mass will be diagonally downwards. Choice B shows that the trajectory will be horizontal to the right. Choice C shows that the trajectory will be to the right but will have a curved shaped where the mass will go up slightly before curving back down. Choice D shows that the trajectory will be diagonally upwards. Choice E shows that the trajectory will swing up and curve towards a counter clockwise direction. Choice F shows that the trajectory of the mass will swing vertically upwards. " width=400>
