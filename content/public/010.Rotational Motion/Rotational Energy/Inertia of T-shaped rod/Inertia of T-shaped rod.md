# {{ params.vars.title }}
Four 'T's are made from two identical rods of equal mass and length.  The Ts are rotated about various rotation axes indicated by the dashed lines in the figures.

## Part 1

For which of the cases below is the resulting rotational inertia a {{ params.choice }}?

<h5>Long Description of image: Four Ts with different rotation axes.</h5>
All four figures show an inverted T. </br>
In Figure a, the dashed line is horizontal, parallel to the base of the inverted T, and is found at the tip of the tail.</br>
In Figure b, the dashed line is horizontal and cuts through the base of the inverted T. </br>
In Figure c, the dashed line is vertical and cuts through the tail of the inverted T. </br>
In Figure d, the dashed line is vertical, parallel to the tail of the inverted T, and cuts through the left end of the base.
