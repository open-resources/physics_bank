# {{ params_vars_title }}
Four 'T's are made from two identical rods of equal mass and length. The 'T's are rotated about various axes indicated by the dashed lines in the figures below.

## Part 1

For which of the cases below is the rotational inertia at a {{ params_choice }}?

<h5>Long Description of image: Four Ts with different rotation axes.</h5>
All four figures show an inverted 'T'. </br>
In Figure (a), the dashed line is horizontal and is located at the top of the inverted 'T'. </br>
In Figure (b), the dashed line is horizontal and is located at the bottom of the inverted 'T'. </br>
In Figure (c), the dashed line is vertical and is located at the middle of the inverted 'T'. </br>
In Figure (d), the dashed line is vertical and located at the left of the inverted 'T'.
<p>Long description ends.</p>
