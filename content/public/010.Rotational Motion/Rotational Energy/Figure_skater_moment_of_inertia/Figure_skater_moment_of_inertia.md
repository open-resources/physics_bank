    params_vars_title: Figure Skater Moment of Inertia
    params_part1_ans1_value: It decreases by a factor of 5.
    params_part1_ans1_feedback: Great, you got it!
    params_part1_ans2_value: It decreases by a factor of 25.
    params_part1_ans2_feedback: Angular momentum $L$ is given by $L = I \omega$, where
      $I$ is the moment of inertia and $\omega$ is angular speed.
    params_part1_ans3_value: It increases by a factor of 5.
    params_part1_ans3_feedback: Careful, moment of inertia increases.
    params_part1_ans4_value: It increases by a factor of 25.
    params_part1_ans4_feedback: Angular momentum $L$ is given by $L = I \omega$, where
      $I$ is the moment of inertia and $\omega$ is angular speed.
    params_part1_ans5_value: It does not change.
    params_part1_ans5_feedback: Angular momentum $L$ must be conserved and is given
      by $L = I \omega$, where $I$ is moment of inertia and $\omega$ is angular speed.
    params_part2_ans1_value: It decreases by a factor of 5.
    params_part2_ans1_feedback: Great, you got it!
    params_part2_ans2_value: It decreases by a factor of 25.
    params_part2_ans2_feedback: Rotational kinetic energy $K_{rot}$ is given by $K_{rot}
      = 1/2 I \omega ^2$, where $I$ is moment of inertia and $\omega$ is angular speed.
      Don't forget that both $I$ and $\omega$ change.
    params_part2_ans3_value: It increases by a factor of 5.
    params_part2_ans3_feedback: Careful, moment of inertia increases.
    params_part2_ans4_value: It increases by a factor of 25.
    params_part2_ans4_feedback: Rotational kinetic energy $K_{rot}$ is given by $K_{rot}
      = 1/2 I \omega ^2$, where $I$ is moment of inertia and $\omega$ is angular speed.
      Don't forget that both $I$ and $\omega$ change.
    params_part2_ans5_value: It does not change.
    params_part2_ans5_feedback: Rotational kinetic energy $K_{rot}$ is given by $K_{rot}
      = 1/2 I \omega ^2$, where $I$ is moment of inertia and $\omega$ is angular speed.

# {{ params_vars_title }}
A figure skater begins a spin with their arms {{ params_arms1 }} and during the spin, they move their arms {{ params_arms2 }}. This changes their moment of inertia from $I\_{\text{arms {{ params_arms1 }}}} = {{ params_I1 }}$ $\rm{kgm^2}$ to $I\_{\text{arms {{ params_arms2 }}}} = {{ params_I2 }}$ $\rm{kgm^2}$ during their spin.

## Part 1

What happens to their angular speed during their spin?
