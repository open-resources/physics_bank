A common problem when assembling a mining drill is attaching the mast tower.
A common method to attach the mast is to attach a chain to the feed cylinders and spin the mast up.
If the feed cylinder lowers at a rate of $v = {{ params_v }} \ \rm{m/s}$, then what is the angular speed the tip of the tower is moving at in the instant shown?
The distance from the chain to the pivot tower is $d_1 = {{ params_d1 }} \ \rm{m}$, the distance from the pivot tower to the end of the mast is $d_2 = {{ params_d2 }} \ \rm{m}$, and the angle between the chain and pivot tower is $\theta = {{ params_theta }} ^{\circ}$
