    part1:
      ans1:
        value: The mass will pull sharply to the left.
      ans2:
        value: The mass will continue in the positive y direction.
      ans3:
        value: The mass will stop.
      ans4:
        value: The mass will continue around the circle.
      ans5:
        value: The mass will be thrown out of the circle with components in the positive
          x and y directions.

A mass, $m$, tied to the end of a string is swung **horizontally** on a frictionless surface in the counter-clockwise direction, exhibiting uniform circular motion as shown in Fig. 1.

<img src="Q3.png" alt="Figure 1. Taking one end of the string as the origin of a Cartesian plane, a mass is atatched to the other end and swung anti-clockwise.">

## Part 1

When the string returns to parallel to the $x$-axis, it is cut in half by a very sharp knife. The subsequent motion of the mass is:
