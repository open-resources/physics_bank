    params_vars_title: Bottle Race
    params_part1_ans1_value: Both bottles will stop at the same height before rolling
      back down the ramp as they both have the same mass.
    params_part1_ans2_value: Bottle 1 has more initial kinetic energy than bottle
      2, so bottle 1 will stop higher up the ramp than bottle 2.  Both bottles will
      roll back down the ramp after stopping.
    params_part1_ans3_value: Bottle 2 has more initial kinetic energy than bottle
      1, so bottle 2 will stop higher up the ramp than bottle 1.  Both bottles will
      roll back down the ramp after stopping.
    params_part1_ans4_value: Bottle 2 has more initial kinetic energy than bottle
      1, so bottle 1 will stop higher up the ramp than bottle 2.  Both bottles will
      roll back down the ramp after stopping.
    params_part1_ans5_value: Bottle 1 has more initial kinetic energy than bottle
      2, so bottle 2 will stop higher up the ramp than bottle 1.  Both bottles will
      roll back down the ramp after stopping.

# {{ params_vars_title }}
Two identical cylindrical water bottles are 80% filled with water.  Bottle 1 is placed in a freezer until the water turns to ice, while bottle 2 remains unfrozen.

## Part 1

If both bottles are given the same initial velocity and roll without slipping **up** a very long ramp, which of the following will be true?(You may ignore any work done by non-conservative forces in this problem).

### Answer Section

- {{ params_part1_ans1_value }}
- {{ params_part1_ans2_value }}
- {{ params_part1_ans3_value }}
- {{ params_part1_ans4_value }}
- {{ params_part1_ans5_value }}
