      title: Bottle Race
    part1:
      ans1:
        value: Both bottles will stop at the same height before rolling back down
          the ramp as they both have the same mass.
      ans2:
        value: Bottle 1 has more initial kinetic energy than bottle 2, so bottle 1
          will stop higher up the ramp than bottle 2.  Both bottles will roll back
          down the ramp after stopping.
      ans3:
        value: Bottle 2 has more initial kinetic energy than bottle 1, so bottle 2
          will stop higher up the ramp than bottle 1.  Both bottles will roll back
          down the ramp after stopping.
      ans4:
        value: Bottle 2 has more initial kinetic energy than bottle 1, so bottle 1
          will stop higher up the ramp than bottle 2.  Both bottles will roll back
          down the ramp after stopping.
      ans5:
        value: Bottle 1 has more initial kinetic energy than bottle 2, so bottle 2
          will stop higher up the ramp than bottle 1.  Both bottles will roll back
          down the ramp after stopping.

# {{ params.vars.title }}
Two identical cylindrical water bottles are 80% filled with water.  Bottle 1 is placed in a freezer until the water turns to ice, while bottle 2 remains unfrozen.

## Part 1

If both bottles are given the same initial velocity and roll without slipping **up** a very long ramp, which of the following will be true?(You may ignore any work done by non-conservative forces in this problem).
