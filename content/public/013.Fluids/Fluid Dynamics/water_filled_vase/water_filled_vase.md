    params_vars_title: Water Filled Vase
    params_part1_ans1_value: Option A
    params_part1_ans1_feedback: Consider how force changes with pressure, and what
      affects pressure.
    params_part1_ans2_value: Option B
    params_part1_ans2_feedback: Make sure the vectors are pointing in the correct
      direction. Is the water pushing or pulling?
    params_part1_ans3_value: Option C
    params_part1_ans3_feedback: Great job! Pressure is equal to Force over Area, so
      the size of the force is proportional to the pressure! Hydrostatic pressure
      increases with depth ( $P = P_{0} + \rho gh$ ) so the vectors should get longer
      with depth.
    params_part1_ans4_value: Option D
    params_part1_ans4_feedback: Make sure the vectors are pointing in the correct
      direction. Is the water pushing or pulling?
    params_part1_ans5_value: Option E
    params_part1_ans5_feedback: Make sure the vectors are pointing in the correct
      direction. Is the water pushing or pulling?

# {{ params_vars_title }}
A water-filled vase is shown below.

<img src="diagram1.png" width = 500 alt = "The image shows 5 different diagrams of an identical water vase, with 3 vectors in each diagram, all in the same position but with varying lengths and direction. Diagram A has vectors pointing outwards, perpendicularly away from the vase and water. The bottom vector is small, the middle a bit longer, with the highest vector being the longest. Diagram B has the same vector lengths as A, just with the vectors pointing in towards the vase and water. Diagram C has vectors pointing outwards like A, but the lengths of the vectors start small from the top and increase in length towards the bottom of the vase, which has the longest vector. Diagram D has the same lengths as C, only with the vectors pointing towards the vase and water. Finally, Diagram E has all 3 vectors of equal length and pointing perfectly upwards.">

## Part 1

Which diagram best shows the direction and the relative lengths of the force the water puts on the vase at the three points indicated?
