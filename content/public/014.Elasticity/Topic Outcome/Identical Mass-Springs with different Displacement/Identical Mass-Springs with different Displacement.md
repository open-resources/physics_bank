# {{ params.vars.title }}
Two identical springs are attached to two identical masses.
Both masses are free to slide along a frictionless horizontal surface.
One of the springs is displaced a distance {{ params.d1 }} from its equilibrium position, while the other is displaced a distance {{ params.d2 }}.

![Using the same point of reference, Spring A is displaced a distance d from its equilibrium position while Spring B is displaced a distance 2d.](q8_2012Final.png)
## Part 1

If both masses are released at the same instant, which of the springs, A or B, returns to its unstretched length first?
