## Question Text

A sample of a certain material is undergoing radioactive decay.
Initially the sample weighs {{ params.a }}g.
After {{ params.T }} days, the sample weighs {{ params.b }}g.
Assuming the rate of decay is proportional to the mass of the sample, compute the half-life of the material.

The half life is:
