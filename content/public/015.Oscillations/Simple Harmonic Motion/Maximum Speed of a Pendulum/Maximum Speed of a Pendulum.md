# {{ params_vars_title }}
A  simple  pendulum  swings  at  small  angles.

## Part 1

If  the  amplitude  and  length  of the pendulum are both {{ params_choice }}, how much is the maximum speed of the pendulum's bob increased/decreased? You may assume that the amplitude remains sufficiently small that it still undergoes simple harmonic motion.

Please enter a real number (symbols will not be accepted).
