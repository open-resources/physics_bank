      title: Kinetic energy from velocity in SHM
    part1:
      ans1:
        value: Figure A
        feedback: What is the period of oscillation of the velocity?  How long should
          it be between zeroes of the potential (kinetic) energy?  Are the periods
          of oscillation of the energy and velocity the same?
      ans2:
        value: Figure B
        feedback: What is the period of oscillation of the velocity?  How long should
          it be between zeroes of the potential (kinetic) energy?  Are the periods
          of oscillation of the energy and velocity the same?
      ans3:
        value: Figure C
        feedback: Great! You got it.
      ans4:
        value: Figure D
        feedback: Noting that the spring constant $k$ is positive, can the elastic
          potential energy $U = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$ ever be negative?
      ans5:
        value: Figure E
        feedback: At the time when the velocity is first zero is the potential or
          kinetic energy at its maximum or minimum?

## Part 1

Identify which of the below graphs represents the kinetic energy as a function of time for a simple harmonic oscillator with velocity $v_x(t) = v\_{max}\sin(\frac{2\pi t}{12} - \frac{\pi}{3})$

<img src="koscillate.png" alt="Image of five graphs. The five graphs represent the kinetic energy as a function of time for a simple harmonic oscillator. Graph A shows positive kinetic energy at all times with K = 0 at t = 1s. Graph B shows positive kinetic energy at all times with K = 0 at t = 1s. Graph C shows positive kinetic energy at all times with K = 0 at t = 2s. Graph D shows negative kinetic energy at 2s < t < 8s with K = 0 at t = 2s and t = 8s. Graph E shows positive kinetic energy at all times with K = 0 at t = 4s." width = "600" height = "500">
