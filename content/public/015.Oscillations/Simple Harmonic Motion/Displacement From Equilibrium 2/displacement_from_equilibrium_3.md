# {{ params.vars.title }}
The displacement of a mass from its equilibrium position as it oscillates on a horizontal spring satisfies the equation $x(t)= Acos(\omega t + \phi_0)$.

## Part 1

At $t = 0 s$, what fraction of the total energy of this oscillator is spring potential energy?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value.
