# {{ params.vars.title }}
The displacement of a mass from its equilibrium position as it oscillates on a horizontal spring satisfies the equation $x(t)= Acos(\omega t + \phi_0)$.

At $t = 0 s$, if $ x = - \frac{A}{2} $, what are the two possible values of $\phi_0$ between 0 and 2$\pi$ radians?

            The displacement of a mass undergoing simple harmonic motion from its equilibrium position can be expressed as $x(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi_0)$ where $A$ is the amplitude of the oscillation (the magnitude of the largest displacement from equilibrium); and $\phi(t) = \omega t + \phi_0$ is the phase, expressed in (dimensionless) radians.  If one thinks of the displacement from equilibrium as the projection of uniform circular motion on the $x$-axis (or $x$-component), $\phi(t)$ represents the angle measured counterclockwise from the $x$-axis as seen in the Figure.  $\omega = rac{2\pi}{T}$ is the angular frequency (in rad/s), $T$ is the period (in seconds), and $\phi_0$ is the value of the phase at $t = 0$ s, also known as the phase constant.
