# {{ params.vars.title }}
The displacement of a mass from its equilibrium position as it oscillates on a horizontal spring satisfies the equation $x(t)= Acos(\omega t + \phi_0)$

At $t = 0 s$, what are the two possible values of the x-components of the velocity of the mass ($v_x$) in terms of $v\_{max}$ that are found when $ x = - \frac{A}{2} $, and which value of $\phi_0$ does each belong to?

## Part 1
