## Part 1

A pendulum with a period of {{ params.Ti }} $\rm{s}$ in one location (g = 9.807 $\rm{m/s^2}$) is moved to a new location where the period is now {{ params.Tf }} $\rm{s}$. What is the acceleration due to gravity at its new location?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in $\rm{m/s^2}$.
