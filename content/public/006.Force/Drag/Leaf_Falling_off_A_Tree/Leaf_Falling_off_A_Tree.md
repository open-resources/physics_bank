        title: Leaf Falling Off A Tree
      part1:
        ans1:
          value: The drag force on the leaf and the force the leaf pushes on the air
            are the same size.
          feedback: Great! You got it.
        ans2:
          value: ' The drag force on the leaf and the weight of the leaf are Newton''s
            third law pairs.'
          feedback: 'Incorrect! The Newton''s third law pair of the drag force on
            the leaf is $F_{air\ on\ leaf}$ = - $F_{leaf\ on\ air}$ . The Newton''s
            third law pair of the weight of the leaf is $F_{Earth\ on\ leaf}$= -$F_{leaf\
            on\ Earth}$ . '
        ans3:
          value: ' The weight of the leaf equals the drag force on the leaf in magnitude.'
          feedback: Incorrect! Acceleration means the weight and drag force are NOT
            equal. The weight of the leaf is greater than the drag force on the leaf.
        ans4:
          value: ' The weight of the leaf is greater than the drag force on the leaf.'
          feedback: Great! You got it. Acceleration means the weight and drag force
            are NOT equal.
        ans5:
          value: ' Although the weight and drag force are equal, the force in the
            direction of motion propels the leaf downward.'
          feedback: Try again! Acceleration means the weight and drag force are NOT
            equal. The direction of the net force is downward. There is no force in
            the direction of motion other than the weight. Based on the Newtonâ€™s third
            law, $F_{air\ on\ leaf}$  = - $F_{leaf\ on\ air}$
