# {{ params.vars.title }}
The drag force grows at $\frac{1}{4} Av^2$.
We saw that a {{params.age}} year old cyclist protected by an airfoil can reach speeds of {{params.v1}} miles per hour, while an unprotected cyclist reaches a top speed of only about {{params.v2}} miles per hour.
At this speed, if the cyclist dropped out of the airfoil and experienced full air resistance, how many times larger than his maximum thrust would it be?
(You may assume that the unprotected cyclist travels at a constant speed).
