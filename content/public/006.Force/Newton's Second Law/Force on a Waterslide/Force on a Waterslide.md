A ${{ params_M }} \rm{kg}$ swimmer travels with a speed of ${{ params_va }} \rm{m/s}$ down a waterslide as they approach point A, as shown in the figure below.
At point A, the slide flattens out before the turn, causing the swimmer to decelerate uniformly to a speed of ${{ params_vc }} \rm{m/s}$ as they pass point C.
In the figure, $R = {{ params_r }} \rm{m}$ and $d = {{ params_d }} \rm{m}$.
You may assume that the swimmer undergoes circular motion starting at point B.

## Part 1

What is the speed of the swimmer as they pass point B?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $\rm{m/s}$.

## Part 2

What is the magnitude of the net force acting on the swimmer at point B?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $\rm{N}$.

## Part 3

What is the magnitude of the horizontal component of normal force acting on the swimmer at point C? Assume the slider does not slip out of the flow.

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in $\rm{N}$.
