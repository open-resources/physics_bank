A {{ params.W }}$kg$ swimmer travels with a speed of ${{ params.va }}m/s$ down the waterslide as they approach point A. At A, the slide flattens out before the turn, causing the swimmer to decelerate uniformly to a speed of ${{ params.vc }}m/s$ as it passes point C on the horizontal unbanked slide.
$R = {{ params.r }}m$, $d = {{ params.d }}m$.

## Part 1

What is the velocity as the swimmer passes point B?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $m/s$.

## Part 2

What is the force at point B?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $N$.

## Part 3

What is the normal force at point C? Assume the slider does not slip out of the flow.

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in $N$.
