# {{ params_vars_title }}
In a game of tug of war, two teams pull on opposite sides of a rope to tug the opposing team towards them.
One team is made of {{params_numberOfChildren}} children.
Their weights are {{params_childWeights}}, and they pull with forces of {{params_childForces}}.
On the other side, a ${{params_adultWeight}} \ \rm{lb}$ adult pulls the rope with a force of ${{params_adultForce}} \ \rm{N}$.

## Part 1

What is the acceleration of the rope with the people?
Give a positive answer if it moves towards the adult, and negative if it moves towards the children.

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $m/s^2$.
