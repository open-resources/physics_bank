    part1:
      ans1:
        value: Has the same magnitude as the weight of the ship.
      ans2:
        value: Is greater than the weight of the ship.
      ans3:
        value: Is exactly balanced by the total force that resists the ship's motion.
      ans4:
        value: Is greater than the total force that resists the ship's motion.
      ans5:
        value: Is greater than both the total force that resists the ship's motion
          and the weight of the ship.
