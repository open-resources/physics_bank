      part1:
        ans1:
          value: Has the same magnitude as the weight of the ship.
        ans2:
          value: Is greater than the weight of the ship.
        ans3:
          value: Is exactly balanced by the total force that resists the ship's motion.
        ans4:
          value: Is greater than the total force that resists the ship's motion.
        ans5:
          value: Is greater than both the total force that resists the ship's motion
            and the weight of the ship.
