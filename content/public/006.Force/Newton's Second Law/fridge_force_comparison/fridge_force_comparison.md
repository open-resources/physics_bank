    part1:
      ans1:
        value: $F_{yr} = 2F_{fr}$
        feedback: Consider whether velocity is directly proportional to force! If
          not, what is?
      ans2:
        value: $F_{yr} = \dfrac{1}{2} F_{fr}$
        feedback: Consider whether velocity is directly proportional to force! If
          not, what is?
      ans3:
        value: $F_{yr} = F_{fr} \neq 0$
        feedback: Great job! You got it!
      ans4:
        value: $F_{yr} = 0, F_{fr} = 0$
        feedback: Consider any external forces resulting from rough surfaces! Also,
          make sure to clarify the difference between applied and net force.
      ans5:
        value: Since $f_{s} \leq \mu_{s}n$, it is impossible to tell
        feedback: Is this static or kinetic friction? Does it depend on speed?

# {{ params.vars.title }}
{{ params.vars.name }} pushes a refrigerator (with force $\vec{F}_{yr}$) at a constant 1 $\rm{m/s}$ across a level rough floor. A second identical refrigerator is pushed (with force $\vec{F}_{fr}$) across the same floor by their friend at a constant 2 $\rm{m/s}$.

## Part 1

Compare the magnitudes of the forces involved while the refrigerators are moving at these speeds.
