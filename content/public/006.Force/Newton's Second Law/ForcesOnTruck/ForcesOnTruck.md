A truck has a cart within its back bed.
To prevent it from rolling out, a ramp is installed.
What is the maximum acceleration force that the engine can apply before the cart goes over the ramp and falls out?
The mass of the truck is $M = {{ params_MT }} \ \rm{kg}$, the ramp has an angle $\theta = {{ params_theta }}^{\circ}$, and the cart has a mass $m = {{ params_mc }} \ \rm{kg}$.
