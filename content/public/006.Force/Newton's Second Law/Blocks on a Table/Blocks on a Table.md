# {{ params.vars.title }}
Blocks A, B, and C are on a frictionless table, connected by massless strings.
Block A has mass {{ params.m1 }} $m$, Block B has mass {{ params.m2 }} $m$, and Block C has mass {{ params.m3 }} $m$.

Block C is pulled to the right by a large force $F_A$ that causes the entire system to accelerate.
