## Part 1

A ringette player pushes a hockey net with a constant force of magnitude $F$ across rough ice at a constant velocity of 2 $\rm{m/s}$. If she pushes the same net with a constant force of magnitude 1.5 $F$ in the same direction across the same ice starting from a velocity of 2 $\rm{m/s}$, the net will move:
