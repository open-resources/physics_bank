# {{ params_vars_title }}
As a car moves down an icy hill, a car changes in velocity from $v = {{ params_v }} \ \rm{km/h}$ to $v_1 = {{ params_v2 }} \ \rm{km/h}$ over the course of $t = {{ params_t }} \ \rm{s}$.
Was the engine braking or pushing over this interval?
What force was put out by the engine?
Assume the mass of the car is M and hill slope is $\theta = {{ params_theta }}^{\circ}$
Assume that braking uphill is negative, accelearting downhill is positive.
