# {{ params.vars.title }}
The velocity as a function of time of an object is as shown in the figure below. The mass of the
object is {{params.m}} $kg$.

<img src="Q3.png" alt="A graph of velocity and time. The object has a velocity of 10 meters per second at 0 to 2 seconds. The object's velocity decreases to 0 meters per second at 6 seconds. The object's velocity is at negative 10 meters per seconds from 10 to 12 seconds." width=300>
