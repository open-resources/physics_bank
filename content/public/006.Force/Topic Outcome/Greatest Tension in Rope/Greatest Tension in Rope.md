<h5>Long Description of image: Figure of four pulley systems.</h5>
System A has a box hanging vertically connected to a rope. The rope goes through a pulley and then connects horizontally to a wall. </br>
System B is a double pulley system. Two blocks hang vertically and are connected to eachother by a rope that passes horizontally through two pulleys. </br>
System C has a two boxes hanging vertically connected to a rope. The rope goes through a pulley and then connects horizontally to a wall.</br>
System D is a double pulley system. Two blocks hang vertically and are connected to one block by a rope that passes horizontally through two pulleys.
