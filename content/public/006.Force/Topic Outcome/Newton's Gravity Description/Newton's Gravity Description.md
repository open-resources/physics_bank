      part1:
        ans1:
          value: Inversely proportional to the distance between the centers of the
            particles.
        ans2:
          value: Directly proportional to the distance between the centers of the
            particles
        ans3:
          value: Directly proportional to the square of the distance between the centers
            of the particles.
        ans4:
          value: Inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the
            centers of the particles.
