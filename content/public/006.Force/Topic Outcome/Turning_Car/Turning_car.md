    params_vars_title: Turning Car
    params_vars_vehicle: semi-truck
    params_part1_ans1_value: There is a force pushing everything to the right.
    params_part1_ans2_value: Your head (and eyes) are not in an inertial reference
      frame, and so things are moving for no reason.
    params_part1_ans3_value: Your semi-truck is moving along a circular path, and
      a centripetal acceleration is required. Without a force to push it towards the
      middle, objects(your shoulders, the soup cans) will NOT move in a circle along
      with the rest of the semi-truck, and so will move relative to the semi-truck's
      interior.
    params_part1_ans4_value: Turning to the right forces your semi-truck to tilt,
      and all the cans and the shoulders shift down-hill.

# {{ params_vars_title }}
If you are sitting in the passenger seat of a {{ params_vars_vehicle}} that makes a quick left turn, your shoulders seem to lean to the right (and all of the soup cans on the floor roll to the right).
