      title: Turning Car
      vehicle: truck
    part1:
      ans1:
        value: There is a force pushing everything to the right.
      ans2:
        value: Your head (and eyes) are not in an inertial reference frame, and so
          things are moving for no reason.
      ans3:
        value: Your truck is moving along a circular path, and a centripetal acceleration
          is required. Without a force to push it towards the middle, objects(your
          shoulders, the soup cans) will NOT move in a circle along with the rest
          of the truck, and so will move relative to the truck's interior.
      ans4:
        value: Turning to the right forces your truck to tilt, and all the cans and
          the shoulders shift down-hill.

# {{ params.vars.title }}
If you are sitting in the passenger seat of a {{ params.vars.vehicle}} that makes a quick left turn, your shoulders seem to lean to the right (and all of the soup cans on the floor roll to the right).
