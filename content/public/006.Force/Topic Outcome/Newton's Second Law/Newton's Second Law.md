        ans1:
          value: $F = mv$, where $F$ is the force, $m$ is the mass, and $v$ is the
            velocity.
        ans2:
          value: $F = ma$, where $F$ is the force, $m$ is the mass, and $a$ is the
            acceleration.
        ans3:
          value: $F = v/m$, where $F$ is the force, $m$ is the mass, and $v$ is the
            velocity.
        ans4:
          value: $F = m/a$, where $F$ is the force, $m$ is the mass, and $a$ is the
            acceleration.
