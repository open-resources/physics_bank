## Question Text

<img src="L14Q3.png" width=80%>

A van drives up a hill, with fuzzy dice attached to the mirror.
If the van constantly accelerates, $a = {{params_a}}m/s^2$, up the hill, which is inclined at ${{params_theta}}^{\circ}$,
then what is the angle $\beta$ created by the dice after all startup movement has ceased?

### Answer Section

Please enter an numerical value in ${{ params_vars_units }}$.
