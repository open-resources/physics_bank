        feedback: Consider whether kinetic or static friction is acting? Is the net
          force truly zero?

        value: at an increasing speed until it reaches 5 $\rm{m/s}$, and then at a
          constant speed
        feedback: Consider whether kinetic or static friction is acting? Which is
          dependent on speed?

        value: at a steadily decreasing speed
        feedback: Consider whether kinetic or static friction is acting? Which is

        value: at 4 $\rm{m/s}$
        feedback: Consider whether kinetic or static friction is acting? Is the net
          force truly zero?

## Part 1

A ringette player pushes a hockey net at {{params.v}} $\rm{m/s}$ across rough ice with a force of magnitude $F$. Draw a free body diagram of the net and upload it as a pdf named "fbd".

### Answer Section

File upload box will be shown here.

## Part 2

If they push the same net across the same ice starting from {{params.v}} $\rm{m/s}$ with a constant force of magnitude {{params.f}} $F$, the net will move:
