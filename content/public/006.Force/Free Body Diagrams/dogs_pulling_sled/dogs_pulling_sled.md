      part3:
        ans1:
          value: Yes, the force of the sled acting on the dogs appears on the free
            body diagram because all forces, including those in force pairs, must
            be included on the diagram for it to be accurate.
          feedback: In a free body diagram, only one of the two forces of an action-reaction
            pair is included.
        ans2:
          value: No, it does not appear. The normal force on the slide is the related
            force and is equal in size.
          feedback: The normal force does not involve the dogs.
        ans3:
          value: No, it does not appear. The tension of the dogs acting on the sled
            is the related force and is equal in size.
          feedback: Great job! You got it.
        ans4:
          value: No, it does not appear. The tension of the dogs acting on the sled
            is the related force and is smaller in size.
          feedback: Consider Newton's third law.

# {{ params.vars.title }}
A sled is pulled by a team of dogs across a level icy surface at constant velocity.

## Part 1

Draw a force identification diagram for the sled. Please upload the drawing as a pdf titled "force.pdf".

### Answer Section

File upload box will be shown here.

## Part 2

Draw a free body diagram for the sled, labelling each force with subscripts indicating the agent of the force and what it acts on. Include the net force beside your diagram by drawing an arrow in its direction, or stating that it is zero.

Please upload the diagram as a pdf titled "fbd.pdf".

### Answer Section

File upload box will be shown here.

## Part 3

Does the force of the sled acting on the dogs appear on your free body diagram? If not, is there a related force that does appear on your free body diagram, and how does it compare in size to this force?
