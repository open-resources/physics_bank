In the figure shown is a pulley system with a box attached with mass ${{params_m}}$ kg. On the other side of the pulley is a person with mass ${{params_M}}$ kg and height ${{params_h}}$ m.
The person leans back at an angle ${{params_theta}}^\circ$  and uses only their weight as leverage on the rope.
Up is negative, down is positive.

## Part 1

What is the acceleration of the box at that moment?
