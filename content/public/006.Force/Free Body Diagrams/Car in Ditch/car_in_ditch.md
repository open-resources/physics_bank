# {{ params_vars_title }}
One way to move a heavy object (like a car) is to attach a strong chain between it and a strong tree and push perpendicular to the chain (see Fig. (a)) to create a large tension. A free body diagram of a piece of the chain is shown in Fig. (b).

<img alt="Free body diagram of a person pushing on a chain between a car and a tree. The chain extends 5 degrees below the x-axis starting from the origin, on both sides of the y-axis. There is a tension, T, on both sides of the chain. At the origin, F sub p on c is acting up along the y-axis. F sub net is equal to zero." src="carditch.png" width=100%>

## Part 1

If the person pushes on the chain with a force of {{ params_F }} {{ params_vars_units }}, the tension in the chain is:
