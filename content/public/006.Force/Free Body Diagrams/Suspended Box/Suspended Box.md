# Forces acting on a Squirrel
A box, suspended by two ropes and possessing a mass of ${{ params_m }}\ \rm{kg}$, remains stationary between two attachment points, referred to as $\rm{A}$ and $\rm{B}$. The ropes form angles of ${{ params_x}}^{\circ}$ and ${{ params_y }}^{\circ}$ with the horizontal at these points, respectively.<br>
