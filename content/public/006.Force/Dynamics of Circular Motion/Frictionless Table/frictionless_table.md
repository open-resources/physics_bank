# {{ params.vars.title }}
A mass $m_1$ is connected to a mass $m_2$ by a massless string that passes through a hole in a table as shown in the figure below. Mass $m_1$ rotates about the hole with radius $r$, while mass $m_2$ hangs below the table. The angular velocity $\omega$ of mass $m_1$ is such that $m_2$ remains at rest.

## Part 1

What is the centripital force $F_c$ acting on mass $m1$?

Note that it may not be necessary to use every variable. Use the following table as a reference for each variable:

| For   | Use |
|-------|-----|
| $m_1$ | m1  |
| $m_2$ | m2  |
| $g$   | g   |
| $r$   | r   |

### Answer Section

## Part 2

What is the velocity of mass $m_1$?

Note that it may not be necessary to use every variable. Use the following table as a reference for each variable:

| For   | Use |
|-------|-----|
| $m_1$ | m1  |
| $m_2$ | m2  |
| $g$   | g   |
| $r$   | r   |

## Part 3

What is the angular velocity of mass $m1$?

Note that it may not be necessary to use every variable. Use the following table as a reference for each variable:

| For   | Use |
|-------|-----|
| $m_1$ | m1  |
| $m_2$ | m2  |
| $g$   | g   |
| $r$   | r   |
