      to the road, and the coefficient of static friction is larger than that of kinetic
      friction.

# {{ params_vars_title }}
Antilock braking systems (ABS) automatically release brakes when wheels are locked.  Once the wheels recommence rolling, the ABS reapplies the brakes.

## Part 1

These stop  a  vehicle  under  slippery  conditions  in  a  more  rapid  and  controlled  fashion because:
