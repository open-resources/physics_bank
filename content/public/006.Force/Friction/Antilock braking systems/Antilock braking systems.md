      title: Antilock Braking Systems
    part1:
      ans1:
        value: The coefficient of rolling friction is larger than that of kinetic
          friction.
      ans2:
        value: The coefficient of kinetic friction is larger than that of rolling
          friction.
      ans3:
        value: In rolling motion, a car's wheels remain at rest relative to the road,
          and the coefficient of static friction is larger than that of kinetic friction.
      ans4:
        value: In sliding motion, a car's wheels remain at rest relative to the road,
          and the coefficient of static friction is larger than that of kinetic friction.
      ans5:
        value: In sliding motion,  a car's wheels remain at rest relative to the car,  and
          the coefficient of kinetic friction is larger than that of static friction.

Antilock braking systems (ABS) automatically release brakes when wheels are locked.  Once the wheels recommence rolling, the ABS reapplies the brakes.

## Part 1

These stop  a  vehicle  under  slippery  conditions  in  a  more  rapid  and  controlled  fashion because:
