## Question Text

Write the expression to find the value of the coefficient of friction between the tires and the road in terms of the mass $m$, velocity $v$, radius $R$, and the acceleration of free-fall $g$.

Note that it may not be necessary to use every variable.

Use the following table as a reference for each variable:

| Variable | Use |
|----------|-----|
| $m$      | m   |
| $v$      | v   |
| $R$      | R   |
| $g$      | g   |

### Answer Section

Enter answer here...
A {{ params.vars.vehicle }} of mass $m$ is driving around a horizontal circular track of radius $R$ at constant speed $v$.
The frictional force between the tires of the {{ params.vars.vehicle }} and the road is at its maximum value.
