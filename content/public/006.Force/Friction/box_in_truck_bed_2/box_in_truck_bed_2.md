# {{ params.vars.title }}
A {{params.vars.vehicle}} is approaching a stop-light as it drives down the road moving in the {{params.vars.direction}} direction.
There is a box in the back of the {{params.vars.vehicle}} which, according to the driver, stays IN PLACE the whole time until the {{params.vars.vehicle}} has come to a complete stop.

## Part 1

What type of friction is acting the box?
From the perspective of a pedestrian watching the {{params.vars.vehicle}} drive past, is the work by the friction force on the box positive, negative, or zero?
