# {{ params.vars.title }}
A {{params.vars.vehicle}} is at a stop-light, with a box sitting in the back.
When the light turns green, the driver accelerates too fast in the {{params.vars.direction}} x-direction.
From the perspective of the driver, the box slides backwards as they accelerate.

## Part 1

What type of friction is affecting the box and which direction is the friction force pointing from the perspective of a pedestrian watching the {{params.vars.vehicle}} (and box) go past?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part1.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans4.value }}
