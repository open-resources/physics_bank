      title: Doorstop
    part1:
      ans1:
        value: Doing so increases the coefficient of friction.
      ans2:
        value: Doing so increases the normal force between the floor and the bottom
          of the wedge.
      ans3:
        value: In this position, moving the door INTO the wedge (to close it) will
          increase the static friction force between the wedge and the floor.
      ans4:
        value: Doing so causes the friction to become kinetic friction instead of
          static friction.
      ans5:
        value: Ghosts. It keeps ghosts from pushing the door shut.

Often a wedge-shaped doorstop won't hold a door open unless you kick it until it sits tightly under the door.

## Question Text

What does forcing the wedge into a tight fit accomplish?
