      title: Cow and Mosquito
    part1:
      ans1:
        value: The force the tail feels is greater than the force that the mosquito
          feels.
        feedback: Consider Newton's laws!
      ans2:
        value: The forces felt by the mosquito and the tail are equivalent.
        feedback: You got it, this is an example of Newton's Third Law!
      ans3:
        value: The force the mosquito feels is greater than the force that the tail
          feels.
        feedback: Consider Newton's laws!
    part2:
      ans1:
        value: The tail accelerates more than the mosquito.
        feedback: Consider the equation for force, and the relationship between mass
          and acceleration!
      ans2:
        value: The mosquito accelerates more than the tail.
        feedback: You got it, the mosquito accelerates much more than the tail! This
          is because its mass is much smaller than that of the tail, so to have the
          forces be equal, it must accelerate much more!
      ans3:
        value: The mosquito and the tail have the same acceleration!
        feedback: Consider the equation for force, and the relationship between mass
          and acceleration!

# {{ params.vars.title }}
A cow swats a mosquito with its tail in mid-air.

## Part 1

Compare the size of the forces that the tail and the mosquito feel from each other.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part1.ans1.value }}
