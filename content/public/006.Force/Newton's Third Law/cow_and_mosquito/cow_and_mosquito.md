    params_vars_title: Cow and Mosquito
    params_part1_ans1_value: The force the tail feels is greater than the force that
      the mosquito feels.
    params_part1_ans1_feedback: Consider Newton's laws!
    params_part1_ans2_value: The forces felt by the mosquito and the tail are equivalent.
    params_part1_ans2_feedback: You got it, this is an example of Newton's Third Law!
    params_part1_ans3_value: The force the mosquito feels is greater than the force
      that the tail feels.
    params_part1_ans3_feedback: Consider Newton's laws!
    params_part2_ans1_value: The tail accelerates more than the mosquito.
    params_part2_ans1_feedback: Consider the equation for force, and the relationship
      between mass and acceleration!
    params_part2_ans2_value: The mosquito accelerates more than the tail.
    params_part2_ans2_feedback: You got it, the mosquito accelerates much more than
      the tail! This is because its mass is much smaller than that of the tail, so
      to have the forces be equal, it must accelerate much more!
    params_part2_ans3_value: The mosquito and the tail have the same acceleration!
    params_part2_ans3_feedback: Consider the equation for force, and the relationship
      between mass and acceleration!

# {{ params_vars_title }}
A cow swats a mosquito with its tail in mid-air.

## Part 1

Compare the size of the forces that the tail and the mosquito feel from each other.

### Answer Section

- {{ params_part1_ans1_value }}
- {{ params_part1_ans2_value }}
- {{ params_part1_ans3_value }}

## Part 2

Compare the size of accelerations that the collision between the cow's tail and the mosquito produces for both the tail and the mosquito.

### Answer Section

- {{ params_part1_ans1_value }}
- {{ params_part1_ans2_value }}
- {{ params_part1_ans3_value }}
