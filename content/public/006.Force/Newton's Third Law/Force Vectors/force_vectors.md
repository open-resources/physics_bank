## Question Text

Newton's $3^{rd}$ law tells us that if two objects are interacting, they will feel equal and opposite force vectors.
The consequence of this is:

### Answer Section

Select all the choices that are true.

Note: You will be awarded full marks only if you select all the correct choices, and none of the incorrect choices. Choosing incorrect choices as well as not choosing correct choices will result in deductions.
