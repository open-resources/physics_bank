      title: Force Vectors
    part1:
      ans1:
        value: If you have a complicated system made of many objects (all interacting
          among themselves) only external forces can add or remove energy from the
          system.
      ans2:
        value: If two objects push on each other, they will accelerate in opposite
          directions.
      ans3:
        value: If two objects push on each other, their velocities will change by
          the same amount (though opposite directions).
      ans4:
        value: If two objects push on each other, their momenta will change by the
          same amount (though opposite directions).
      ans5:
        value: If you have a complicated system made of many objects (all interacting
          among themselves) only external forces can cause the center of mass of the
          system to accelerate.

## Question Text

Newton's $3^{rd}$ law tells us that if two objects are interacting, they will feel equal and opposite force vectors.
The consequence of this is:

### Answer Section

Select all the choices that are true.

Note: You will be awarded full marks only if you select all the correct choices, and none of the incorrect choices. Choosing incorrect choices as well as not choosing correct choices will result in deductions.
