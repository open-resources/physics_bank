# {{ params_vars_title }}
The 2 $cm$ long diabolical ironclad beetle is reported to survive forces as high as 149 $N$, roughly 39000 times its body weight ([here's the reference](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2813-8) if you don't believe us)!
In commenting on this work, Elizabeth Pennisi notes that this force is about four times larger than the strongest humans exert when squeezing the beetle between the thumb and forefinger.

## Part 1

If your thumb exerts a force of {{ params_f }} $N$ on a diabolical ironclad beetle,
