    part1:
      ans1:
        value: The drag force on the leaf
        feedback: Pairs do not act on the same object. This is a force between the
          air and the leaf.
      ans2:
        value: The normal force of the ground acting on the leaf
        feedback: The contact force with the ground is not gravity
      ans3:
        value: The drag force of the leaf acting on the air
        feedback: Try again!
      ans4:
        value: The force of gravity of the leaf pulling upward on the Earth
        feedback: Newton's third law relates the forces between two objects. $F_{A\
          on\ B}$  = - $F_{B\ on\ A}$ . $W_{Leaf}$ = $W_{Earth\ on\ Leaf}$ = - $W_{Leaf\
          on\ Earth}$ . Weight is the force of gravity. The gravitational force acts
          between two massive bodies.
      ans5:
        value: The terminal velocity of the leaf.
        feedback: Not a force!
