    params_part1_ans2_value: When a π rad phase change occurs upon reflection from
      the front but not the back surface of a thin film, constructive interference
      occurs if half a wavelength fits in twice the film thickness.
    params_part1_ans2_feedback: Correct! Nice work
    params_part1_ans3_value: When a π rad phase change occurs upon reflection from
      both the front and back surfaces of a thin film, constructive interference occurs

# {{ params_vars_title }}

## Question Text

{{ params_vars_name }} is given a list of statements about interference of light waves and has to identify all of the __{{ params_choice }}__ statements. Can you help?

### Answer Section

Select all the choices that that apply.

Note: You will be awarded full marks only if you select all the correct choices, and none of the incorrect choices. Choosing incorrect choices as well as not choosing correct choices will result in deductions.

- {{ params_part1_ans1_value}}
- {{ params_part1_ans2_value}}
- {{ params_part1_ans3_value}}
