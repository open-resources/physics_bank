    part1:
      ans1:
        value: Reflects almost all light hitting it since light reflects with the
          same phase from both surfaces and the path length difference is much less
          than the wavelength of the visible light.
        feedback: In order to have constructive interference of reflected blue light,
          we need a path length difference of ($λ_{blue}$)/(2*$n_{turpentine}$) which
          is equal to 136 nm. No light will be reflected from this thin film since
          our path length is much less than the required difference(path length<<136nm).
      ans2:
        value: will appear blue since ($λ_{blue}$)/2 = $26 nm$
        feedback: The correct formula for this question is ($λ_{blue}$)/(2*$n_{turpentine}$).
          In order to have constructive interference of reflected blue light, we need
          a path length difference of ($λ_{blue}$)/(2*$n_{turpentine}$)= (400nm)/(2
          x 1.47)=136nm. No light will be reflected from this thin film since our
          path length is much less than the required difference(path length<<136nm).
      ans3:
        value: 'Will appear blue since ($λ_{blue}$)/(2*$n_{turpentine}$)= $26 nm$ '
        feedback: You have used the correct formula however the answer is (400nm)/(2
          x 1.47)=136nm and not 20 nm. In order to have constructive interference
          of reflected blue light, we need a path length difference of ($λ_{blue}$)/(2*$n_{turpentine}$)=
          (400nm)/(2 x 1.47)=136nm. No light will be reflected from this thin film
          since our path length is much less than the required difference(path length<<136nm).
      ans4:
        value: Will look like a normal water surface since both water and turpentine
          are transparent.
        feedback: Try again please!
      ans5:
        value: Will reflect almost no light as light reflects with different phases
          from each surface and the path length difference is much less than the wavelength
          of visible light.
        feedback: Great! You got it.  In order to have constructive interference of
          reflected blue light, we need a path length difference of ($λ_{blue}$)/(2*$n_{turpentine}$)=
          (400nm)/(2 x 1.47)=136nm. No light will be reflected from this thin film
          since our path length is much less than the required difference(path length<<136nm)

Turpentine is a liquid extracted from pine tree resin and used to remove paint from paint brushes. Being less dense than water it will float on the surface of water if you rinse it off your hands after using it.

## Part 1

A {{ params.Y }} nm thick thin film of turpentine ($n\_{turpentine}=1.47$) on top of water ($n\_{water}=1.33$) will:
