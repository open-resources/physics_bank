# {{ params.vars.title }}
The transverse displacement of a traveling wave on a string is described by the formula $D(x,t) = {{ params.amplitude}} cm \, {{  params.wave_equation }}(\frac{2\pi}{({{ params.wavelength}}) \text{cm}} x - \frac{2\pi}{({{ params.period}})  \text{s}} t + \frac{\pi}{2})$

## Part 1

What is the amplitude of this wave?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in {{ params.vars.units }}.

## Part 2

What is the wavelength of this wave?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in {{ params.vars.units }}.

## Part 3

What is this wave's {{ params.wave}}?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in {{ params.vars.units }}.

## Part 4

What is the speed at which energy travels down this wave?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in {{ params.vars.units }}.

## Part 5

A. Draw a snapshot graph for this wave taken at $t = 0$ s, from $x = 0$ cm to $x = 2$ cm.
Indicate and label the wavelength on your graph.

B. Draw a history graph of the motion of the string at $x = 0.5$ cm from $t = 0$ s to $t = 4$ s.
Indicate and label the period on your graph.

C. Draw a graph of the velocity of the piece of string at $x = 0.5$ cm as a function of time.

Finally, upload your graphs as a png file named '$\textbf{wave}$'.
