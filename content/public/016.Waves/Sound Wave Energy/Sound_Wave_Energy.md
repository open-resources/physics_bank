      title: Sound Wave Energy
    factor: tripled
    part1:
      ans1:
        value: stays the same
        feedback: No, the energy carried by a sound wave is related to the amplitude
          of the sound wave's pressure oscillations.
      ans2:
        value: decreases by a factor of 3
        feedback: No, the energy carried by a sound wave is not inversely proportional
          to the amplitude of the sound wave.
      ans3:
        value: decreases by a factor of 9
        feedback: No, the energy carried by a sound wave is not inversely proportional
          to the square of the amplitude of the sound wave.
      ans4:
        value: increases by a factor of 9
        feedback: Yes, for a simple harmonic oscillator the total energy goes as the
          square of the amplitude of the oscillation, and any point on a sinusoidal
          sound wave undergoes simple harmonic motion.
      ans5:
        value: increases by a factor of 3
        feedback: No, the energy carried by a sound wave is not directly proportional
          to the amplitude of the sound wave.
