# {{ params.vars.title }}
Musical instruments tune to the note A at a frequency of {{ params.f }}.  The speed of sound in the air is 330 m/s at room temperature.  An open-open tube (a flute) plays this note as its fundamental (first harmonic) while an open-closed tube (a clarinet) plays this note as its third harmonic.

## Part 1

What is the ratio of the effective length of the open-closed tube to the open-open tube is $\frac{L\_{\text{clarinet}}}{L\_{flute}}$?
