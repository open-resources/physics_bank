# {{ params_vars_title }}
The electric field strength that causes the breakdown of dry air is $3.00\times 10^6\rm\ V/m$.

## Question Text

If the potential difference across a pair of parallel conducting plates is {{ params_V }} $\rm\ V$, at what distance between the plates will breakdown just start to occur?
Give your answer in units of $\rm mm$.

### Answer Section
