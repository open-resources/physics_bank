# {{ params.vars.title }}
Concentric conducting spherical shells carry charges of $Q$ and $-Q$ as shown in the figure.
The inner shell of radius $a$ has negligible thickness.
The outer shell has an inner radius $b$.

## Question Text

Find an expression for the potential difference between the shells.
In your expression, use Coulomb's constant $k$ to represent $1/(4\pi\varepsilon_0)$.
