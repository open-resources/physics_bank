# {{ params.vars.title }}
An electron enters a region between two large parallel plates made of aluminum separated by a distance of ${{ params.d }}\rm\ cm$ and kept at a potential difference of ${{ params.V }}\rm\ V$.
The electron enters through a small hole in the negative plate and moves toward the positive plate.
At the time the electron is near the negative plate, its speed is ${{ params.s }}\times 10^{ {{ params.p }} }\rm\ m/s$.

## Question Text

Assuming the electric field between the plates is uniform, find the speed of the electron when it is ${{ params.x }}\rm\ cm$ from the negative plate.

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value.
