# {{ params.vars.title }}
The surface charge density on a long straight hollow metallic pipe is Ï.  Assume the pipe has a diameter of $2a$.

## Part 1

What is the electric potential inside the pipe?
Choose the zero of electric potential to be a distance $R_0>a$ from the axis of the pipe.

You may copy the Greek symbols Ïµ0 and Ï into your symbolic expression.
