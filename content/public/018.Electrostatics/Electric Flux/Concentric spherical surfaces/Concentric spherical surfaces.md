      part1:
        ans1:
          value: The larger sphere has greater electric flux passing through it.
        ans2:
          value: The smaller sphere has greater electric flux passing through it.
        ans3:
          value: The same electric flux passes through each sphere.

## Part 1

Two concentric spherical surfaces enclose a point charge $q$.
The radius of the outer shpere is twice that of the inner one.

Compare the electric fluxes crossing the two surfaces.
