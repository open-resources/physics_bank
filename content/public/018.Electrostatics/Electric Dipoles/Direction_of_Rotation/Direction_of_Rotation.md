    params_part3_ans3_value: The molecule experiences a net torque tending to rotate
      the dipole so that the F atom is closer to charged sphere

      the dipole so that the F atom is further away from charged sphere

Hydrogen fluoride is a polar molecule with a bond length of about 0.92 x 10-10 m and can be roughly modeled as having a point charge of 6.6 x 10-20 C on the hydrogen atom and another of -6.6 x 10-20 C on the fluorine atom.
