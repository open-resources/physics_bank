## Part 1

Two arbitrary charges lie along the $x$-axis.

Regardless of the values of the two point charges, there will always be a point along the $x$-axis at which the electric field vanishes (other than +/- infinity).

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part1.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans2.value }}

Consider a pair of equal but opposite point charges.  The electric field is non-zero at all points along the $x$-axis (except +/- infinity).
