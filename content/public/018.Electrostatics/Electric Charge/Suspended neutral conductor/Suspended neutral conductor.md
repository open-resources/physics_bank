## Part 1

An uncharged conducting sphere is suspended from the ceiling as shown in the figure.
A negatively charged rod is brought nearby.

The neutral conductor is:

### Answer Section

- {{ params_part1_ans1_value }}
- {{ params_part1_ans2_value }}
- {{ params_part1_ans3_value }}

The conducting sphere becomes polarized and is attracted to the charged rod.
