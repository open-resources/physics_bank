        title: Correct and Incorrect Statements
        name: Abbas
      choice: 'TRUE'
      part1:
        ans1:
          value: If a system is in electrostatic equilibrium, no charge is moving.
          feedback: Correct! Nice work
        ans2:
          value: If a conductor is in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field
            lines will always intersect its surface at right angles.
          feedback: Correct! Nice work
        ans3:
          value: A conductor in electrostatic equilibrium must have a net charge of
            0.
          feedback: Not quite - Try again!

# {{ params.vars.title }}

## Part 1

{{ params.vars.name }} is given a list of statements about systems in electrostatic equilibriums and has to identify all of the  {{ params.choice }} statements. Can you help?

### Answer Section

Select all the choices that that apply.

Note: You will be awarded full marks only if you select all the correct choices, and none of the incorrect choices. Choosing incorrect choices as well as not choosing correct choices will result in deductions.
