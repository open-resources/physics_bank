# {{ params.vars.title }}
It has been reported (Journal of Plant Studies) that the diameters of trees ($d$) are proportional to their height ($h$) as the $2/3$ scaling exponent ($d \propto h^{\frac{2}{3}}$).

## Question Text

If the diemeter of a {{ params.height1 }} $m$ tall tree is {{ params.diameter1 }} $cm$, what is your prediction for the diameter of a {{ params.height2 }} $m$ tall tree?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in {{ params.vars.units }}.
