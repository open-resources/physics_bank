      part1:
        ans1:
          value: The analysis is concerned only with the motion of the center of mass
        ans2:
          value: The dimensions of the object are small compared to those of surrounding
            objects
        ans3:
          value: The forces acting on the body are non-concurrent
        ans4:
          value: The mass of the body is negligible
