# {{ params.vars.title }}
A  uranium-238  atom  can  break  up  into  a  thorium-234  atom  and  a  particle  called  an *alpha particle*, $\alpha$-4.  The numbers indicate the masses of the atoms and alpha particle in atomic mass units (1 amu = $1.55\times 10^{-27}$ kg).  So, for example, the uranium atom has a mass of 238 amu.

## Part 1

When a uranium atom breaks up,  the thorium atom is observed to recoil with a velocity of {{ params.v }}$\times 10^5$ $m/s$. How much of the uranium atom's internal energy is released in the breakup? Assume that the uranium atom was initially at rest.

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in {{ params.vars.units }}.
