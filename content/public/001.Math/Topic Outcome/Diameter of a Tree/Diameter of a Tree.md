## Question Text

It has been reported (Journal of Plant Studies) that the diameters of trees ($d$) are proportional to their height ($h$) as the $2/3$ scaling exponent, $d \propto h^{2/3}$. If the diameter of a {{ params.h_t1 }} $m$ tree is {{ params.d_t1 }} $cm$, what is your prediction for the diameter of a {{ params.h_t2 }} $m$ tree in $cm$?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $m$.
