# {{ params.vars.title }}
The figure shows the velocity of a particle as it travels along the x-axis.

<img src="Q1.png" width=300 alt="Graph of velocity versus time, a parabola-like shape that is concave up. The x-axis represents time and the x-axis represents velocity. It slopes downwards from t=0 to t=1, then slopes upward form t=1 to t=4. The y intercept is 4m/s an the x intercepts are t=0.5 and t=2.">

## Part 1

What is the direction of the acceleration at $t$ = {{params.t}} s?
