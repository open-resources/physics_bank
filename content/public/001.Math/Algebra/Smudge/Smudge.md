# {{ params_vars_title }}
{{ params_vars_name }} is writing a physics test, and their formula sheet has a smudge on it, making it hard to read the exponent of one of their equations, which describes the energy stored in a spring.
Their copy reads $U = \frac{1}{2}kx^?$, where $?$ represents the number that they can't read.
Rather than asking the instructor (WHICH YOU SHOULD ALWAYS DO WHEN WRITING A TEST!), {{ params_vars_name }} decides to use dimensional analysis to figure out the power.
{{ params_vars_name }} remembers that the units of energy, $U$, are \[$U$\] = $J$ = $Nm$, the units of the spring constant, $k$, are \[$k$\] = $\frac{\text{N}}{\text{m}}$, and the units of position, $x$, are \[$x$\] = $m$,  where 1 $N$ = 1 $kg$ $\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2}$.

## Part 1

Express the units of $U$ in terms of $kg$, $m$ and $s$.

Note that it may not be necessary to use every variable. Use the following table as a reference for each variable.

| For  | Use   |
|----------|-------|
| $kg$  | kg  |
| $m$  | m  |
| $s$  | s  |

### Answer Section

## Part 2

Express the units of $k$ in terms of $kg$, $m$ and $s$.

Note that it may not be necessary to use every variable. Use the following table as a reference for each variable.

| For  | Use   |
|----------|-------|
| $kg$  | kg  |
| $m$  | m  |
| $s$  | s  |

### Answer Section

## Part 3

Solve for the value of $?$.
