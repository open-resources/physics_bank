## Question Text

It is known that the equation for the force of drag is $F_D = \frac{1}{2}{\rho}v^2C_DA$, where $\rho$ is density, $v$ is velocity, $C_D$ is the coefficient of drag, and $A$ is area.

What is the dimensions of the coefficient of drag?

Note that it may not be necessary to use every variable. Use the following table as a reference for each variable:

| For  | Use |
| ---- | ----|
| $M$  | M   |
| $L$  | L   |
| $T$  | T   |
