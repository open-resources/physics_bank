The conveyor above contains a slide plate below the belt, which is used for structure.
This plate gives a coefficient of friction of $\mu = {{ params_mu }}$ between the plate and the belt.
The belt is then loaded with a load, with a weight density of $W = {{ params_W }} \ \rm{lb/ft}$.\
How much horsepower is required to run the belt at a velocity of $v = {{ params_v }} \ \rm{ft/s}$ ?
The belt is $L = {{ params_L }} \ \rm{ft}$ long and angled at $\theta = {{ params_theta }}^{\circ}$.
Assume the load is constantly fed onto the belt and transitions smoothly.
Assume the belt itself is massless.
