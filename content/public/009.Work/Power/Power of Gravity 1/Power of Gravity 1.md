A mass, $m = {{params_m}} \ \rm{kg}$, is dropped from rest at the top of the slide shown in the above figure. The ball falls due to its own weight only, following the path of the slide without any bouncing. This slide is inclined at an angle $\theta = {{params_theta}}^{\circ}$ with the x-axis.

## Part 1

Find the power lost due to gravity at $t = {{ params_t }} \ \rm{s}$. Assume no friction force and that only slipping occurs.

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $\rm{W}$.
