# {{ params.vars.title }}
{{params.vars.name}} stands on a cliff, and gently lowers a bucket of water to the ground using a rope. The bucket starts out with an initial downwards velocity, but {{ params.vars.name }} is tightening their grip on the rope as it slides through their hands, so that is slows as it descends, and when the bucket touches the ground it has zero velocity.

Consider the energy in the situation and how the work is being done if the system consists of **only the bucket**.

## Part 1

Is the system open or closed?

### Answer Section

- {{params.part1.ans1.value}}
- {{params.part1.ans2.value}}
- {{params.part1.ans3.value}}

## Part 2

What types of energy are in the system? Are they increasing or decreasing?

### Answer Section

Select all the choices that apply.

Note: You will be awarded full marks only if you select all the correct choices, and none of the incorrect choices. Choosing incorrect choices as well as not choosing correct choices will result in deductions.

- {{params.part2.ans7.value}}
- {{params.part2.ans8.value}}
- {{params.part2.ans9.value}}
- {{params.part2.ans10.value}}

## Part 3

### Answer Section

- {{params.part3.ans1.value}}
- {{params.part3.ans2.value}}
- {{params.part3.ans3.value}}
