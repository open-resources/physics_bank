# {{ params.vars.title }}
Calculate the work done by a constant force of magnitude $F = $ {{ params.F }} $N$ applied over a displacement of magnitude $\Delta r = $ {{ params.r }} $m$ for all four of the diagrams.

<h5>Long Description of image: Image of the force acting at different angles to the displacement.</h5>
Figure a shows the force acting perpendicular to the displacement.</br>
Figure b shows the force acting at an angle of sixty degrees to the displacement. The force F is horizontal and acts to the right.</br>
Figure c shows the force acting parallel to the displacement and in the same direction.</br>
Figure d shows the force acting parallel to the displacement but in the opposite direction.</br>
