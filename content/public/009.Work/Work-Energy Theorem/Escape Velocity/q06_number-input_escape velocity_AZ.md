# Escape Velocity
A rocket is fired from the surface of the Earth with speed $v\ \rm{ms^{-1}}$.

## Part 1

What is the minimum speed **$v$** with which a rocket, which has a mass of ${{ params_m }}\ \rm{tonnes}$ would need to be fired from the surface of the earth to escape the earth's gravitational field (i.e gravitational force goes to zero).<br>
<br>Treat the rocket as a single particle and neglect air resistance. Assume the mass of the rocket remains constant throughout its motion. Neglect local gravitational effects in the vicinity of the launch point.
<br>
The diameter of the earth is $d = 12742km$, the mass of the earth is $M\_{earth} = 5.976\times 10^{24}\ \rm{kg}$
