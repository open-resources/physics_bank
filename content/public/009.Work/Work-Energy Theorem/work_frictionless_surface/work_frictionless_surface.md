    part1:
      ans1:
        value: equal to the work required to accelerate the object from v = 0 to v
      ans2:
        value: twice the work required to accelerate the object from v = 0 to v
      ans3:
        value: three times the work required to accelerate the object from v = 0 to
          v
      ans4:
        value: four times the work required to accelerate the object from 2v to 3v
      ans5:
        value: not known without knowledge of the acceleration
