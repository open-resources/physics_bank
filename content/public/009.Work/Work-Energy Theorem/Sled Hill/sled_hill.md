# {{ params_vars_title }}
{{ params_vars_name }} is on a sled, sliding down a snow covered hill sloped at {{ params_angle }}$^\circ$ (relative to the horizontal). In travelling a distance $d$ the sled has descended through a vertical distance of $10 \, \rm{m}$.

## Part 1

Draw a pictorial representation of this problem and solve for $d$. Clearly label the distance travelled, the starting and ending positions, the height, and the angle.
Your file must be a pdf titled "part1.pdf".

## Part 2

If the coefficient of kinetic friction between the sled and snow is $\mu_k = $ {{ params_uk }} and drag can be ignored, draw a free body diagram of the forces acting on the rider and sled system once they have started moving.

## Part 3

Write Newton's second law in component form and solve for the force of kinetic friction on the rider and sled system if their combined mass is {{ params_m }} kg.

## Part 4

Find the work done by the frictional force on the rider and sled system. (Hint: are the frictional force and displacement in the same or opposite directions?)

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in J.

## Part 5

Find the speed of the rider and sled at the bottom of the hill, neglecting drag, but including friction. The rider and sled start from rest at the top of the hill.

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in m/s.
