# {{ params.vars.title }}
{{ params.vars.name }} decides to go bungee jumping. Starting atop a very high bridge, elastic cords are tied to their feet and they jump off the bridge. Once {{ params.vars.name }} has fallen a certain distance, the force of the bungee cords slows their descent until they are at the lowest point.

## Part 1

If the system under consideration is: {{ params.vars.name }}, the air, and the earth; discuss the work done by the bungee cord as {{ params.vars.name }} descends. Assume the positive y direction is up.
