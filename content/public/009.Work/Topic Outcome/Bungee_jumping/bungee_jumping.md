# {{ params_vars_title }}
{{ params_vars_name }} decides to go bungee jumping. Starting atop a very high bridge, elastic cords are tied to their feet and they jump off the bridge. Once {{ params_vars_name }} has fallen a certain distance, the force of the bungee cords slows their descent until they are at the lowest point.

## Part 1

If the system under consideration is: {{ params_vars_name }}, the air, and the earth; discuss the work done by the bungee cord as {{ params_vars_name }} descends. Assume the positive y direction is up.

### Answer Section

- {{ params_part1_ans1_value }}
- {{ params_part1_ans2_value }}
- {{ params_part1_ans3_value }}
- {{ params_part1_ans4_value }}
