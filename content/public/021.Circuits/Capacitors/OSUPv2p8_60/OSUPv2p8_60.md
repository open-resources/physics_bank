# {{ params.vars.title }}
Two parallel plates have equal and opposite charges. When the space between the plates is evacuated, the electrical field is $E = {{params.a }} \times 10^5 \textrm{ V/m}$. When the space is filled with dielectric, the electrical field is $E = {{params.b }} \times 10^5 \textrm{ V/m}$.

## Part 1

What is the surface charge density on each surface of the dielectric?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value.

## Part 2

What is the dielectric constant?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value.
