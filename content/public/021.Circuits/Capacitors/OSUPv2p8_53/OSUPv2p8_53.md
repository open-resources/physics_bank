# {{ params.vars.title }}
A parallel-plate capacitor has charge of magnitude {{params.q }} $\rm\ \mu\textrm{C}$ on each plate and capacitance {{params.c }} $\rm\ \mu\textrm{F}$  when there is air between the plates.
The plates are separated by {{params.d }} $\textrm{ mm}$.
With the charge on the plates kept constant, a dielectric with $\kappa = $ {{params.k }} is inserted between the plates, completely filling the volume between the plates.

## Part 1

What is the potential difference between the plates of the capacitor before the dielectric has been inserted?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value.

## Part 2

What is the potential difference between the plates of the capacitor after the dielectric has been inserted?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value.

## Part 3

What is the electrical field at the point midway between the plates before the dielectric is inserted?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value.

## Part 4

What is the electrical field at the point midway between the plates after the dielectric is inserted?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value.
