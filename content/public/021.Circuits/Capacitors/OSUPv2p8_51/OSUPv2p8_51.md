# {{ params.vars.title }}
An air-filled capacitor is made from two flat parallel plates ${{params.d }} \textrm{ mm}$ apart. The inside area of each plate is ${{params.a }} \rm\ cm^2$.

## Part 1

What is the capacitance of this set of plates? Enter your answer in units of pF.

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value.

## Part 2

If the region between the conductors is filled with a material whose dielectric constant is ${{params.k }}$, what is the new capacitance? Enter your answer in units of pF.

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value.
