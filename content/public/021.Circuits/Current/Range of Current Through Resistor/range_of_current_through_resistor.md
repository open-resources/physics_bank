# {{ params.vars.title }}
A resistor rated at ${{params.R}}\rm\ k\Omega$ is connected across two D cell batteries (each ${{params.V}} \textrm{ V}$) in series, with a total voltage of ${{params.Vtotal}} \textrm{ V}$.
The manufacturer advertises that their resistors are within ${{params.p}} \%$ of the rated value.
What are the possible minimum current and maximum current through the resistor?
