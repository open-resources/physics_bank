# {{ params.vars.title }}
A resistor rated at {{params.R}} $\rm\ k\Omega$ is connected across two D cell batteries (each {{params.V}} $\textrm{ V}$) in series, with a total voltage of {{params.Vtotal}} $\textrm{ V}$.
The manufacturer advertises that their resistors are within {{params.p}} $\%$ of the rated value.
What are the possible minimum current and maximum current through the resistor?
