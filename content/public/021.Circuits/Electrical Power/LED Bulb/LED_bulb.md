## Question Text

A more sustainable alternative to CFL bulbs and incandescent bulbs are light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs.
A 100-W incandescent bulb can be replaced by a 16-W LED bulb. Both produce 1600 lumens of light.

Assuming the cost of electricity is $\rm\ {$}{{params.c}}$ per kilowatt-hour, how much does it cost to run the LED bulb for one year if it runs for {{params.h}} hours a day?
