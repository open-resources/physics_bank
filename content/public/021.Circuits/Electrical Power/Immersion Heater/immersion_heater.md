      title: Immersion Heater
    part1:
      ans1:
        value: It will double
      ans2:
        value: It will be quartered
      ans3:
        value: It will be halved
      ans4:
        value: It will triple
      ans5:
        value: It will stay the same
    part2:
      ans1:
        value: Yes, since it would take a much shorter time to heat the water.
      ans2:
        value: No, since the device is rated for a specific power and could possibly
          burn up.
      ans3:
        value: It does not matter since it does not affect the time.

An immersion heater is a small appliance used to heat a cup of water for tea by passing current through a resistor.
## Part 1

If the voltage applied to the appliance is doubled, by how much will the time required to heat the water change?
