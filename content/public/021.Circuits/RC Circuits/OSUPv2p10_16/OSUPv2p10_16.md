      title: RC Circuit with a Switch
    part1:
      ans1:
        value: Nothing. Current cannot flow across the capacitor, so the lamp remains
          dark.
      ans2:
        value: When the switch is first closed, the current through the lamp is high
          and the lamp shines brightly. As the capacitor charges, the current decreases
          to zero, and the brightness of the lamp decreases until it becomes completely
          dark.
      ans3:
        value: When the switch is first closed, the current through the lamp is low
          and the lamp shines dimly. As the capacitor charges, the current increases
          and the brightness of the lamp increases until it becomes very bright.
      ans4:
        value: Current flows and the lamp turns on.
      ans5:
        value: As the capacitor charges and discharges, the current flowing in the
          circuit fluctuates, causing the lamp to fluctuate between being bright and
          dark.
