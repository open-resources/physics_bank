    params_vars_title: RC Circuit with a Switch
    params_part1_ans1_value: Nothing. Current cannot flow across the capacitor, so
      the lightbulb remains dark.
    params_part1_ans2_value: When the switch is first closed, the current through
      the lightbulb is high and the lightbulb shines brightly. As the capacitor charges,
      the current decreases to zero, and the brightness of the lightbulb decreases
      until it becomes completely dark.
    params_part1_ans3_value: When the switch is first closed, the current through
      the lightbulb is low and the lightbulb shines dimly. As the capacitor charges,
      the current increases and the brightness of the lightbulb increases until it
      becomes very bright.
    params_part1_ans4_value: Current flows and the lightbulb turns on.
    params_part1_ans5_value: As the capacitor charges and discharges, the current
      flowing in the circuit fluctuates, causing the lightbulb to fluctuate between
      being bright and dark.

A battery, switch, capacitor, and lightbulb are connected in series.
The switch is initially open.
