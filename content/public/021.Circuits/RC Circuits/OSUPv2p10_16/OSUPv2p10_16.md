      title: RC Circuit with a Switch
    part1:
      ans1:
        value: Nothing. Current cannot flow across the capacitor, so the lightbulb
          remains dark.
      ans2:
        value: When the switch is first closed, the current through the lightbulb
          is high and the lightbulb shines brightly. As the capacitor charges, the
          current decreases to zero, and the brightness of the lightbulb decreases
          until it becomes completely dark.
      ans3:
        value: When the switch is first closed, the current through the lightbulb
          is low and the lightbulb shines dimly. As the capacitor charges, the current
          increases and the brightness of the lightbulb increases until it becomes
          very bright.
      ans4:
        value: Current flows and the lightbulb turns on.
      ans5:
        value: As the capacitor charges and discharges, the current flowing in the
          circuit fluctuates, causing the lightbulb to fluctuate between being bright
          and dark.
