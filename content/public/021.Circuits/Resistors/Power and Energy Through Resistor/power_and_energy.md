# {{ params_vars_title }}
A {{params_V}} $\textrm{ V}$ battery is used to supply current to a {{params_R} $\rm\ k\Omega$ resistor.
Assume the voltage drop across any wires used for connections is negligible.

## Part 1

What is the current through the resistor?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value.
