# {{ params_vars_title }}
Suppose {{ params_vars_name }} is doing a physics lab that asks them to put a resistor into a circuit, but all the resistors supplied have a {{ params_have }} resistance than the requested value.

## Part 1

How would {{ params_vars_name }} connect the available resistances to attempt to get the {{ params_want }} value asked for?

### Answer Section

- {{ params_part1_ans1_value }}
- {{ params_part1_ans2_value }}
- {{ params_part1_ans3_value }}
