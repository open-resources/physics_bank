# {{ params.vars.title }}
Suppose {{ params.vars.name }} is doing a physics lab that asks them to put a resistor into a circuit, but all the resistors supplied have a {{ params.have }} resistance than the requested value.

## Part 1

How would {{ params.vars.name }} connect the available resistances to attempt to get the {{ params.want }} value asked for?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part1.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans3.value }}
