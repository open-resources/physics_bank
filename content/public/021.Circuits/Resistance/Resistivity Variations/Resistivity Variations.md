    params_vars_title: Resistivity Variations
    params_part1_ans1_value: The resistivity of the copper pipe increased at lower
      temperatures, resulting in decreased induced currents, and the induced magnetic
      fields opposed the magnet's falling.
    params_part1_ans1_feedback: Try Again!
    params_part1_ans2_value: The resistivity of the copper pipe decreased at lower
      temperatures, resulting in increased induced currents, and the induced magnetic
      fields opposed the magnet's falling.
    params_part1_ans2_feedback: Great! You got it.
    params_part1_ans3_value: The rate of change in the magnetic flux in the pipe caused
      by the falling magnet was greater in the colder pipe, resulting in a larger
      induced emf.
    params_part1_ans3_feedback: Try Again!
    params_part1_ans4_value: Copper became magnetic at the lower temperature, so the
      magnet stuck to its side.
    params_part1_ans4_feedback: Try Again!
    params_part1_ans5_value: Copper became superconducting at the lower temperature
      so it expelled the magnet.
    params_part1_ans5_feedback: Try Again!

# {{ params_vars_title }}
Dropping a strong magnet through a $20 \textrm{ cm}$ copper tube took about $3 \textrm{ s}$ when the pipe was at room temperature and $4 \textrm{ s}$ when the pipe had been cooled in liquid nitrogen for a short period of time.

## Part 1

The magnet fell more slowly through the cooled pipe because:
