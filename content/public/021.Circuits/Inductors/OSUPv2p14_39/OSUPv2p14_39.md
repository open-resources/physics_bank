# {{ params_vars_title }}
A coil with a self-inductance of ${{ params_L }}\rm\ H$ carries a current that varies with time according to $I(t) = ({{ params_I0 }}{\rm\ A}) \sin{\!({{ params_k }} \pi t)}$.

## Question Text

Find an expression for the emf induced in the coil.
You should provide a symbolic answer in terms of the following variables and expressions: $\pi$, $t$, $\sin()$, and $\cos()$.

Note that it may not be necessary to use every variable. Use the following table as a reference for each variable:

| For      | Use   |
|----------|-------|
| $\pi$    | pi    |
| $t$      | t     |
| $\sin()$ | sin() |
| $\cos()$ | cos() |
