# {{ params.vars.title }}
Solenoid $A$ is tightly wound while solenoid $B$ has windings that are evenly spaced with a gap equal to ${\rm {{ params.num }}} d$, where $d$ is the diameter of the wire.
The solenoids are otherwise identical.

## Question Text

Determine the ratio of the energies stored per unit length of these solenoids when the same current flows through each.
