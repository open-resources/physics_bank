A marble is spun in a cone that has a radius ${{params_R}}$ m and height ${{params_H}}$ m with an initial velocity of ${{params_v}}$ m/s tangent to the horizontal rim of the cone. As the marble spins around the bowl, its rotational radius r shrinks. As the marble descends, where r  = ${{params_r}}$ m, the velocity vector makes an angle $\theta$ with the horizontal. Determine the new velocity magnitude and $\theta$ in degrees.

## Part 1

What is $\lvert v \rvert$?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in {{ params_vars_units }}.

## Part 2

What is $\theta$?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $\circ$.
