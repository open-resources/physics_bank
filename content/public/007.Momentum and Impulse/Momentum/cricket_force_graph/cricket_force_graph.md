      part1:
        ans1:
          value: 8 $\rm{kg m/s}$
          feedback: Are you considering the change in momentum for the cricket bat
            or the cricket ball?
        ans2:
          value: -8 $\rm{kg m/s}$
          feedback: Great! You got it.
        ans3:
          value: -16 $\rm{kg m/s}$
          feedback: Please check your calculation again!
        ans4:
          value: 12 $\rm{kg m/s}$
          feedback: Please check your calculation again!
        ans5:
          value: Cannot be found from this information.
          feedback: The answer can be determined by using the graph!

# {{ params.vars.title }}
The force that a cricket bat puts on a cricket ball as a function of time is shown in the diagram below.

<img src="diagram1.png" alt = "Image is of a Force (N) vs. Time (ms) graph. From t = 0 to 10ms, it is 0N. From 10ms to 20ms, there is a linear slope from 0N to 800N. From 20ms to 30ms, there is a linear slope from 800N to 0N. From 10ms to 30ms, this shape is formed: /\. From 30ms onwards, there is 0N of force." >

## Part 1

The change in momentum of the cricket bat due to this collision is:
