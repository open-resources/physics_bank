# {{ params.vars.title }}
To measure the interaction force between a basketball and the backboard, we attached a force plate to the backboard. When a {{ params.m }} $\rm{g}$ basketball hit the force plate with a speed of {{ params.v }} $\rm{m/s}$, a graph of force of the plate on the ball versus time ($\rm{ms}$) was recorded as shown in the figure.

<img src="chart.png" alt="A graph where time is measured in milliseconds along the x-axis, and Force sub x is measured in Newtons along the y-axis. The force increases linearly from (0,0) to (4,5000), and then decreases linearly from (4,5000) to (7,0), forming a triangle." width=500>

## Part 1

What was the rebound speed of the ball from the plate? \[Hint: since the force is in the $+x$-direction, the ball must be thrown in the $-x$-direction.\]

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $\rm{m/s}$.
