On a pulley system, there is a crate with a mass of $m_A = {{params_mA}} \ \rm{kg}$, and another crate $m_B = {{params_mB}} \ \rm{kg}$. Both are released from rest.

## Part 1

What is the speed of crate A after $t= {{params_t}} \ \rm{s}$?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $\rm{m/s}$.

## Part 2

What is the speed of crate B after $t= {{params_t}} \ \rm{s}$?

### Answer Section
