    params_vars_title: Throwing an Egg
    params_vars_name: Emilia
    params_part1_ans1_value: The energy in the egg is not sufficient to allow it to
      break.
    params_part1_ans2_value: The egg experiences an elastic collision with the sheet.
    params_part1_ans3_value: The time interval over which the egg slows down in short
      enough that the net force acting on the egg is not large enough for it to break.
    params_part1_ans4_value: The impulse acting on the egg is not as large as if the
      egg hit a brick wall.
    params_part1_ans5_value: The time interval over which the egg slows down is large
      enough that the acceleration of the egg is not large enough for it to break.

# {{ params_vars_title }}
{{ params_vars_name }} throws an egg as hard as they can towards a bed sheet held vertically by two of their friends.
The bottom of the sheet is shaped like a "J" to catch the egg after if falls.

## Part 1

The egg does not break.

This is because:
