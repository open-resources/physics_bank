    part1:
      ans1:
        value: The energy in the egg is not sufficient to allow it to break.
      ans2:
        value: The egg experiences an elastic collision with the sheet.
      ans3:
        value: The time interval over which the egg slows down in short enough that
          the net force acting on the egg is not large enough for it to break.
      ans4:
        value: The impulse acting on the egg is not as large as if the egg hit a brick
          wall.
      ans5:
        value: The time interval over which the egg slows down is large enough that
          the acceleration of the egg is not large enough for it to break.

# {{ params.vars.title }}
{{ params.vars.name }} throws an egg as hard as they can towards a bed sheet held vertically by two of their friends.
The bottom of the sheet is shaped like a "J" to catch the egg after if falls.

## Part 1

The egg does not break.

This is because:
