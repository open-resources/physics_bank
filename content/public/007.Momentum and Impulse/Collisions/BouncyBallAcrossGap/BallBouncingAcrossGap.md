# {{ params_vars_title }}
A rubber ball is launched off a platform $h_1={{params_h1}} \ \rm{m}$ high with an initial velocity $v={{params_v}} \ \rm{m/s}$ at an angle ${{params_theta}}^\circ$.
The ball bounces its way onto another platform $h_2={{params_h2}} \ \rm{m}$ high.
The coefficient of restitution between the ball and the ground is ${{params_e}}$.
The ball just barely makes it onto the platform.
In other words, if the platform was any farther, the ball wouldn't have made it.
