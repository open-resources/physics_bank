# {{ params.vars.title }}
A {{params.m}} $kg$ block is initially at rest on a sheet of ice.
An internal explosion occurs, splitting the object into two pieces of masses $m_A$ = {{params.m_a}} $kg$ and $m_B$ = {{params.m_b}} $kg$.
After the explosion, block A is measured to have a velocity of $\vec{v}\_A$ = {{params.v_a}} $m/s$

## Question Text

Assuming that there's no friction, how much energy did the explosion release?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in {{ params.vars.units }}.
