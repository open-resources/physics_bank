Two cars experience a "T-bone" collision at an intersection.
Car A has a mass of ${{params_ma}}kg$, and Car B has a mass of ${{params_mb}}kg$.
The cars become entangled and move with a common velocity in the direction shown.
If Car A was travelling at ${{params_vak}}km/h$ when impacted, calculate the corresponding velocity of Car B at impact.
$\theta= {{params_thetad}}^\circ$
