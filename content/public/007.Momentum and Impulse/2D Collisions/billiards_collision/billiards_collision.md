# {{ params.vars.title }}
In a game of billards, a red billiard ball is traveling in the positive x-direction with speed $v$ and the cue ball is traveling in the negative x-direction with speed $3v$.
The two balls collide head on and the collision is elastic.
The two balls have the same mass.

## Part 1
