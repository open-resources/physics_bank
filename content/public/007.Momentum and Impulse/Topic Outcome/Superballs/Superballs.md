# {{ params.vars.title }}
Superballs have nearly elastic collisions with both hard floors and other superballs.  A small superball (mass $m_s$) is dropped directly on top of a large superball of mass $m_l$, both falling from rest from a height $h$.  After an initial collision with the floor, the large superball heads directly upwards at speed $v$, where it collides elastically with the smaller ball, also moving at speed $v$ downward.

## Part 1

If the large ball has speed $0$ following the elastic collision, what is the final speed of the smaller ball, $v_f$?

Use conservation of momentum.

Write your answer in terms of the mass of the larger ball $m_l$, the mass of the smaller ball $m_s$, and velocity $v$.

Use the following table as a reference for each variable. Note that it may not be necessary to use every variable.

| For  | Use   |
|----------|-------|
| $m_l$  | m_l  |
| $m_s$  | m_s  |
| $v$  | v  |

### Answer Section

## Part 2

In order for this to be an elastic collision, what must the ratio of the masses be?

### Answer Section

## Part 3

Following this collision, what maximal height will the small ball reach?

Express your answer in terms of $h$, the height from which both balls were dropped.

| For  | Use   |
|----------|-------|
| $h$  | h  |

### Answer Section

## Part 4

If we replaced the top ball with a "sad" ball, which undergoes a perfectly inelastic collision with the returning "happy" ball, to what height would the "sad" ball return following the collision in terms of $h$, the height from which both balls were dropped?  (For this question, assume that $\frac{m_l}{m_s} = $ {{ params.ratio }}).

| For  | Use   |
|----------|-------|
| $h$  | h  |
