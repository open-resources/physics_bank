# {{ params.vars.title }}
A force versus time graph for the force on a mosquito is given in the figure below.

## Question Text

Calculate the change in momentum of the mosquito due to this impulsive force.

<img src="mosquito.png" width=400px alt = "A graph of force in Newtons versus time in seconds times ten to the negative 3 (milliseconds). The Force increases from 0 to 2 Newtons in the first millisecond, then from 2 to 8 Newtons in the second increment, then 8 to 2 Newtons in the third increment and 2 to 0 Newtons in the fourth increment" >

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in {{ params.vars.units }}.
