A skater dips into a hemispherical bowl ($r_0 = {{params.ro}}m$) with an initial velocity of $v_0 = {{params.vo}}m/s$ tangent to the horizontal rim of the bowl.
As the skater rounds the bowl, its rotational radius $r$ shrinks.
As the skater passes point B, which is $h = {{params.h}}m$ below the rim, and $r$ from the centre line, the velocity makes an angle $\theta$ with the horizontal tangent of the bowl through B.
Determine $\theta$.
