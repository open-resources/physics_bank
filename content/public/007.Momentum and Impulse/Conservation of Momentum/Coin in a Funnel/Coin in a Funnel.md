A coin is inserted into a donation machine. It leaves the entry track with a velocity of ${{params.vo}}$ m/s horizontally in a funnel, making an angle $\alpha$.
Determine the angle $\theta$ which its velocity makes with the horizontal as the coin passes bottom of the funnel.
Assume the coin always remains spinning on its thin edge.
$r = {{params.r1}}$ m, The radius of the opening at the bottom is $r2 = {{params.r2}}$ m, $\alpha= {{params.ad}}^\circ$

## Part 1

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $^\circ$.
