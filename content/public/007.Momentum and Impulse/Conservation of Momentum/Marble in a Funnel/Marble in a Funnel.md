A marble is launched with a velocity of {{params.vo}}m/s horizontally in a funnel.
Determine the angle $\theta$ which its velocity makes with the horizontal as the marble passes level O-O in the funnel.
$R = {{params.r1}}m$, $R2 = {{params.r2}}m$, $\alpha= {{params.ad}}^\circ$

## Part 1

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $^\circ$.
