# {{ params.vars.title }}
Two {{params.mw}} $g$ blocks of wood are {{params.d}} $m$ apart on a frictionless table.
A {{params.mb}} $g$ bullet is fired at {{params.v0}} {{ params.vars.units }} toward the blocks.
It passes all the way through the first block, then embeds itself in the second block.
The speed of the first block immediately afterwards is {{params.v1}} $\frac{m}{s}$.

## Question Text

What is the speed of the second block after the bullet stops in it?
Give your answer to three significant figures.

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in {{ params.vars.units }}.
