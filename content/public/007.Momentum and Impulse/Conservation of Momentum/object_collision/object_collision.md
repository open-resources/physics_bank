        title: Object Collision
      part1:
        ans1:
          value: The sum of the impulses on the system is non-zero.
          feedback: Consider what it means to have an isolated system!
        ans2:
          value: The impulse on one object is the same as the impulse on the other
            object.
          feedback: Recall that impulse is a vector quantity!
        ans3:
          value: The change in speed of one object is equal but opposite to the change
            in speed of the other object.
          feedback: This is only true in the case where they have the same mass.
        ans4:
          value: Each object will experience an impulse, but these impulses will cause
            equal but opposite changes in the objects' momenta.
          feedback: Great job! You got it
        ans5:
          value: Whichever object started with more momentum will continue to have
            more momentum.
          feedback: Review the law of conservation of momentum!
