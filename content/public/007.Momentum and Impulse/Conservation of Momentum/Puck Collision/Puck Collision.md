Consider a system of two pucks on a frictionless surface. An orange puck moving with velocity $\vec{v\_{oi}}$ collides with a blue puck that is initially at rest. At the time of the collision, a small explosion injects {{ params.E }} $J$ of energy into the system. Afterwards, the pucks move as shown in the figure below.

<h5>Long Description of image: Figure of the system described.</h5>
Before the collision. The orange puck moves with horizontal velocity v o i (o for orange and i for initial) towards the right. The blue puck is at rest.<br>
After the collision. Both pucks move in opposite directions. The orange puck moves with a velocity v o f (f for final) at an angle theta with respect to the positive x-axis. The blue puck moves with a velocity v b f (b for blue) at an angle phi with respect to the positive x-axis.
