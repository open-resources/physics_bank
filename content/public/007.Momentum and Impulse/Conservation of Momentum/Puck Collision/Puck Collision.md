# {{ params_vars_title }}
Consider a system of two pucks on a frictionless surface. An orange puck moving with velocity $\vec{v\_{oi}}$ collides with a blue puck that is initially at rest. At the time of the collision, a small explosion injects {{ params_E }} $J$ of energy into the system. Afterwards, the pucks move as shown in the figure below.

<h5>Long Description of image: Figure of the system described.</h5>
Before the collision. The orange puck moves with horizontal velocity v<sub>oi</sub> (o for orange and i for initial) towards the right. The blue puck is at rest.<br>
After the collision. Both pucks move in opposite directions. The orange puck moves with a velocity v<sub>of</sub> (f for final) at an angle theta with respect to the positive x-axis. The blue puck moves with a velocity v<sub>bf</sub> (b for blue) at an angle phi with respect to the positive x-axis.
