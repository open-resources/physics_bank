# {{ params.vars.title }}
A reckless driver speeds around a highway corner on the edge of a cliff, ${{params.z0}}ft$ above the ground, which has a radius of R = ${{params.y0}}ft$.
Their speed is constant at ${{params.vx0}}ft/s$.
As they pass the edge of the corner, they toss out an empty can, with a velocity of ${{params.vy0}}ft/s$ relative to the car.
Calculate the coordinates of the point of impact, neglect air resistance.
