On a relatively quiet lake, two boats approach each other.
Boat A has been speeding in circles, $r = {{params.r}}m$, at a constant speed of {{params.v}}km/hr.
When A is as shown, B is $d = {{params.d}} m$ from the curve representing A's path, and is accelerating at a rate of ${{params.a}} m/s^2$.
Assume $\theta = {{params.theta}}^{\circ}$.

## Part 1

What is the acceleration of A as seen by Boat B?

### Answer Section

## Part 2

What is the angle of the acceleration vector of A measured from the west axis?
