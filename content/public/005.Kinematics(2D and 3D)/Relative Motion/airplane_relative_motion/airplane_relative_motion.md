# {{ params.vars.title }}
An airplane flying at {{params.v1}} $\rm{km/h}$ at {{params.theta}} $^{\circ}$ West of South relative to the air is subjected to a jet stream to the East of {{params.v2}} $\rm{km/h}$ , relative to the ground.

Note: To convert from km/h to m/s, divide by 3.6!

## Part 1

Draw a vector diagram showing how to graphically find $\vec{v\_{pg}}$ , the velocity of the plane relative to the ground as a vector sum of the two given vectors. On your diagram also label $\vec{v\_{pa}}$ , the velocity of the plane relative to the air, and $\vec{v\_{ag}}$ , the velocity of the air relative to the ground.

Please upload your drawing as a pdf file titled "vector.pdf"

### Answer Section

File upload box will be shown here.

## Part 2

Define an $xy$ coordinate system with $x$ pointing to the East and $y$ pointing to the North. Solve for ($v\_{pa}$)$\_x$, the $x$-component of the plane relative to the air.

Please enter in a numeric value.

## Part 3

Solve for ($v\_{pa}$)$\_y$, the $y$-component of the plane relative to the air.

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value.

## Part 4

Solve for ($v\_{ag}$)$\_x$, the $x$-component of the air relative to the ground.

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value.

## Part 5

## Part 7

Using some of your previous answers, solve for the speed of the airplane relative to the ground, $v\_{pg}$.

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value.

## Part 8

Solve for the angle West of South of the airplane relative to the ground.

### Answer Section
