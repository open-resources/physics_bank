Plane A enters a trick shown in the path above, at a constant speed of ${{params.v_A}} km/h$ relative to the pilot in plane B, who flies in a straight line at a constant speed of ${{params.v_B}} km/h$ relative to an observer on the ground.
Both planes are in a horizontal plane.
In the above figure, $\theta\_{1} = {{params.theta1}}$, $\theta\_{2} = {{params.theta2}}$, $d\_{1} = {{params.d1}}$, and $d\_{2} = {{params.d2}}$.
Note that the line between $\theta\_{1}$ and $\theta\_{2}$ is parallel to the y-axis.

## Part 1

What is the x-component of the velocity that plane A appears to have at C relative to the observer on the ground?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $km/h$.

## Part 2

What is the y-component of the velocity which plane A appears to have at C relative to the observer on the ground?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $km/h$.

## Part 3

What is the x-component of the velocity which plane A appears to have at E relative to the observer on the ground?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $km/h$.

## Part 4

What is the y-component of the velocity which plane A appears to have at E relative to the observer on the ground?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $km/h$.
