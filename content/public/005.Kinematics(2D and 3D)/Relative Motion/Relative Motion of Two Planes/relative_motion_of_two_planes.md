Airplane B is moving towards refueling tanker A in the moment shown.
B is to arrive at A {{params.t}} minutes from when shown, and A has a velocity of ${{params.v}} mi/hr$.
Assume $h = {{params.h}} ft$ and $d = {{params.d}} ft$.

## Part 1

What velocity should B maintain?

### Answer Section

## Part 2

What is the angle of the velocity vector of B?
