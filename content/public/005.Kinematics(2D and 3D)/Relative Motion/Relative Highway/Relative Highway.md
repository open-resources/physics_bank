# {{ params_vars_title }}
Three cars are driving on different lanes on a highway.
At $t = 0 \ \rm{s}$, car 1 is in the front travelling at a constant speed of ${{params_v1}} \ \rm{m/s}$.
Car 2 is ${{params_d}} \ \rm{m}$ behind car 1 and has a constant speed such that it will catch car 1 in ${{params_t}} \ \rm{s}$.
Car 3 is in between them travelling at a constant speed of ${{params_v3}}  \ \rm{m/s}$.

## Part 1

What is the speed of car 2 relative to car 3?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $\rm{m/s}$.
