# {{ params_vars_title }}
A ball rotated at constant speed in a circle from a string of length $L$ has a rotation period $T$. The string is shortened to a length $\frac{L}{{{ params_N }}}$ while its rotation period in circular motion remains $T$.

## Part 1

What is the ratio of the accelerations of the ball rotated by the longer string to the ball rotated by the shorter string?
