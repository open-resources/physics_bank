A lifeguard watches a swimmer train while sitting at their chair, fixed at point O.
They swim at $v = {{params.v}}$ m/s, while they slow them at a rate of ${{params.a}}$ m/s^2$ in the moment shown.
Determine the following values where $r$ is the length between the lifeguard and swimmer, $h = {{params.h}}$ m and $x = {{params.x}}$ m.

## Part 1

Determine the value of $\ddot{r}$
