# {{ params.vars.title }}
A hawk glides in a straight line at constant speed without descending with a squirrel grasped in its talons from time $t_0$ until it accidentally releases the squirrel at time $t_1$. The hawk continues to glide in the same direction at constant speed while the squirrel hits the ground at time $t_2$.

Representing the hawk in the particle model as a filled circle, and the squirrel as an open circle, and neglecting air resistance:

## Part 1

Draw a motion diagram for the hawk from times $t_0$ to time $t_1$ by hand, take a picture, and upload it. Show five equal time intervals between these times.
Your file must be a pdf, titled "diagram1".

### Answer Section

File upload box will be shown here.

## Part 2

Draw a motion diagram for each of the hawk and squirrel from times $t_1$ to $t_2$ by hand, take a picture, and upload it.
Your file must be a pdf, titled "diagram2".

## Part 3

Will the squirrel continue to move forward horizontally in the direction of the hawk as it falls? Explain your answer.

### Answer Section

Answer in 2-3 sentences, try and use full sentences.

## Part 4

When the squirrel is about to hit the ground will it be in front of, behind, or directly below the hawk? Explain your answer.

### Answer Section

Answer in 2-3 sentences, try and use full sentences.

## Part 5

Just before the squirrel hits the ground how will its speed compare to when it was in the hawk's talons? Explain your answer.

### Answer Section

Answer in 2-3 sentences, try and use full sentences.
