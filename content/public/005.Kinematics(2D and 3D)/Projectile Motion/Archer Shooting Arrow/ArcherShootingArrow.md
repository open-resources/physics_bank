An archer shoots an arrow up into the air to hit a bird with an initial speed of $v = {{ params_v }}$ ft/s.
Their friend, who is standing $d = {{ params_d }}$ft away, sees the arrow at an angle of $\theta = {{ params_thetad }}^{\circ}$ with respect to the horizontal.

## Part 1

At what time will the friend see the arrow pass by their line of site?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in s.

## Part 2

What is the vertical velocity of the arrow at this time?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in ft/s.

## Part 3

The archer misses the bird, causing the arrow to come straight back down.
At what time since fire will the arrow pass the line of site of the friend again?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in s.

## Part 4

What will its vertical velocity be at this time?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in ft/s.
