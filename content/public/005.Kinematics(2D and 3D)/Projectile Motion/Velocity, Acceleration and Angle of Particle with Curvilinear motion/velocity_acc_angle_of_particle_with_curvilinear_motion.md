# {{ params.vars.title }}
A particle moves in space with curvilinear motion.
Its coordinates change based on time, with $x = 5t^2 - 3t$ and $y = 3t^2 - t^3/3$.

## Part 1

Determine the magnitude of velocity after {{params.t}} seconds have passed.

### Answer Section

## Part 2

Determine the angle of the velocity after {{params.t}} seconds have passed.

### Answer Section

## Part 3

Determine the magnitude of acceleration after {{params.t}} seconds have passed.

### Answer Section

## Part 4

Determine the angle of the acceleration after {{params.t}} seconds have passed.
