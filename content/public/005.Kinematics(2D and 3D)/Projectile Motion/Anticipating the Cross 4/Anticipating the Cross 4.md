A player is crossing the ball forwards towards the goal. The striker in the front needs to anticpate the cross and run towards where the ball will land. The ball is propelled at a speed of $v_0 = {{params_v0}} \ \rm{m/s}$ with an angle ${\theta}\_0  = {{params_theta0}}^{\circ}$ above the horizental, and an angle ${\phi}\_0 = {{params_phi0}}^{\circ}$.

<br>
The striker starts accelerating from rest to anticipate the ball at the point of impact. <br>

Find the constant acceleration and direction ${\phi}\_p$ the striker needs to be running at to anticipate the ball at the point of impact.

## Part 1

What is the acceleration of the striker?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $\rm{m/s^2}$.

## Part 2

What is the angle ${\phi}\_p$?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $\rm{^{\circ}}$.
