# {{ params_vars_title }}
At a local pumpkin patch, {{ params_vars_name }} is hired to create a Hallowe'en gourd launcher.  {{ params_vars_name }} wants to launch a {{ params.m_gourd }} $kg$ gourd (decorated as an "Angry Bird") at a large pumpkin (decorated as a "pig") which sits on top of a $h =$ {{ params_h }} $m$ tall hay bale as shown in the figure.

Assume that the gourd undergoes projectile motion and that it hits the pumpkin ("pig") with a velocity of $\overrightarrow{v} =$ {{ params.v_f }} $\hat{x} + 0 \hat{y} \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}} $.

(You may assume the initial height of where the gourd is launched from to be negligible.)
