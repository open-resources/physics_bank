# Projectile Motion on an Incline
A tennis ball is projected with a speed of u at angle of Î¸ measured counter-clockwise from the normal to the inclined plane.

<img src="part1.png" width=600>

## Part 1

Determine the range R of the tennis ball if it hits the incline at the end of its motion.<br>
Treat the ball as a particle and neglect any resistive forces.<br><br>
$u = {{ params_u }}ms^{-1}$, $\theta = {{ params_theta }}\circ$, $\alpha = {{ params_a }}\circ$

### Answer Section

Please enter the range in $m$.
