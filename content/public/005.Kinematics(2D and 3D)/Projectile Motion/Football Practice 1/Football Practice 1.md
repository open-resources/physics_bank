A football player is practicing some of their lob passes at the training academy. They strike the ball giving it a velocity of $v = {{params_v}} \ \rm{m/s}$ at an angle $\theta  = {{params_theta}}^{\circ}$. The training field has a special geometry governed by these paramaters: $h_1 = {{params_h1}} \ \rm{m} $, $h_2 = {{params_h2}} \ \rm{m} $, $d_1 = {{params_d1}} \ \rm{m} $, and $d_2 = {{params_d2}} \ \rm{m} $.
