## Part 1

Which of the below sets of graphs is consistent with projectile motion? Assume that gravity acts in the negative $y$-direction.

<h5>Long Description of image: Figure of six graphs.</h5>
- Graph (i) is a displacement-time graph and it has a symmetric peak shape. </br>
- Graph (ii) is a displacement-time graph. It is a straight line with a positive y-intercept.</br>
- Graph (iii) is a displacement-time graph. It starts at a positive y-value and forms the right half of a trough (concave up and increasing) before forming a horizontal line.</br>
- Graph (iv) is a velocity-time graph. It starts at the origin and then forms the right half of a peak (concave down and decreasing).</br>
- Graph (v) is a velocity-time graph. It is a straight line with negative slope and positive y-intercept.</br>
- Graph (vi) is a velocity-time graph. It is a horizontal line which crosses the vertical axis at a positive value.
<p>Long description ends.</p>
