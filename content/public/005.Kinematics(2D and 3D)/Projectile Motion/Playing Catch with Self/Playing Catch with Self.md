A child wants to launch a projectile with mass $m$ at a speed of $v_0 =  {{ params_v }} \ \rm{m/s}$. There is a gust of wind blowing at an angle of $\theta_2$ = ${{ params_theta }}^\circ$ and will apply a force on their projectile at $F = {{ params_a }}.m \ \rm{N}$.

## Part 1

At what angle should the ball be thrown for it to return to their hand?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in {{ params_vars_units }}.
