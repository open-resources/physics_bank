    params_v: 3
    params_part1_ans1_value: directly overhead.
    params_part1_ans2_value: well in front of the seed.
    params_part1_ans3_value: well behind the seed.
    params_part2_ans1_value: The final speed of the seed is bigger than the bird's
      speed because despite having the same horizontal velocity component as that
      of the bird, it also has a large vertical component.
    params_part2_ans2_value: The final speed of the seed is smaller than the bird's
      speed because the bird is no longer pulling it.
    params_part2_ans3_value: The final speed of the seed is the same as the bird's
      speed.
    params_part2_ans4_value: The final speed of the seed is smaller than the bird's
      speed because the bird maintains its horizontal speed.

# {{ params_vars_title }}
A bird gliding at a constant {{ params_v }} $m/s$ drops an apple seed from its beak.

## Part 1

Assuming air resistance is negligible and that the bird maintains its velocity, when the seed hits the ground the bird is:

### Answer Section

- {{ params_part1_ans1_value }}
- {{ params_part1_ans2_value }}
- {{ params_part1_ans3_value }}

## Part 2

Is the final speed of the seed bigger or smaller than the bird's speed just before the seed hits the ground?  Explain your answer.

### Answer Section

- {{ params_part2_ans1_value}}
- {{ params_part2_ans2_value}}
- {{ params_part2_ans3_value}}
- {{ params_part2_ans4_value}}
