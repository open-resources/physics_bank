    v: 5
    part1:
      ans1:
        value: directly overhead.
      ans2:
        value: well in front of the seed.
      ans3:
        value: well behind the seed.
    part2:
      ans1:
        value: The final speed of the seed is bigger than the bird's speed because
          despite having the same horizontal velocity component as that of the bird,
          it also has a large vertical component.
      ans2:
        value: The final speed of the seed is smaller than the bird's speed because
          the bird is no longer pulling it.
      ans3:
        value: The final speed of the seed is the same as the bird's speed.
      ans4:
        value: The final speed of the seed is smaller than the bird's speed because
          the bird maintains its horizontal speed.

# {{ params.vars.title }}
A bird gliding at a constant {{ params.v }} $m/s$ drops an apple seed from its beak.  Draw a diagram of this process, showing the time the seed leaves the bird's beak, the time the seed its the ground, and the paths of the bird and seed during this time.

## Part 1

Assuming air resistance is negligible and that the bird maintains its velocity, when the seed hits the ground the bird is:

- {{ params.part1.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans3.value }}

## Part 2

Is the final speed of the seed bigger or smaller than the bird's speed just before the seed hits the ground?  Explain your answer.

- {{ params.part2.ans1.value}}
- {{ params.part2.ans2.value}}
- {{ params.part2.ans3.value}}
- {{ params.part2.ans4.value}}
