      title: Turning Car
      vehicle: pickup truck
    part1:
      ans1:
        value: There is a force pushing everything to the right.
      ans2:
        value: Your head (and eyes) are not in an inertial reference frame, and so
          things are moving for no reason.
      ans3:
        value: Your pickup truck is moving along a circular path, and a centripetal
          acceleration is required. Without a force to push it towards the middle,
          objects(your shoulders, the soup cans) will NOT move in a circle along with
          the rest of the pickup truck, and so will move relative to the pickup truck's
          interior.
      ans4:
        value: Turning to the right forces your pickup truck to tilt, and all the
          cans and the shoulders shift down-hill.

# {{ params.vars.title }}
If you are sitting in the passenger seat of a {{ params.vars.vehicle}} that makes a quick left turn, your shoulders seem to lean to the right (and all of the soup cans on the floor roll to the right).
