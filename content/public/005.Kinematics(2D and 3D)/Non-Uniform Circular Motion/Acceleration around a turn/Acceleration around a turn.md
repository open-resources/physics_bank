# {{ params.vars.title }}
As you drive *{{ params.vars.dir }}* around a turn (as viewed from above), you see backed-up traffic ahead and so you slow down.
## Part 1

In which of the figures below does the arrow best represent the acceleration of the {{ params.vars.vehicle }}?

<div id="desc">
<h5>Long Description of image: Figures of the same vehicle with the acceleration arrow pointing in different directions.</h5>
Figure A shows the acceleration arrow perpendicular to the vehicle and pointing to the center of the circle. </br>
Figure B shows the acceleration arrow pointing south west.</br>
Figure C shows the acceleration arrow pointing north west.
<p>Long description ends.</p>
