# {{ params_vars_title }}
A newly modified race car is on a race track to test out its speed, acceleration, and the overall build.
If it starts at rest on the race track with a radius of $r = {{params_r}} \ \rm{m}$ and increases its speed at a constant rate of $a_t = {{params_at}} \rm{m/s^2}$

## Part 1

What is the net acceleration $t = {{params_t}} \rm{s}$ later after the start?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in {{ params_vars_units }}

## Part 2

Find the angle the acceleration vector makes of the race car at the time above

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in {{ params_vars_units }}
