# {{ params_vars_title }}
Conventional kinesin is a motor protein that moves stepwise along microtubules carrying membrane-bound organelles toward the periphery of cells. It is powered by the hydrolysis of ATP (PubMed, 1999). Assume that the steps of the motion are {{ params_dist }} $nm$ (the distance between adjacent tubulin binding sites), each step takes about {{ params_t }} $\mu s$, and on average there is {{ params_delay }} $ms$ delay between steps.

## Question Text

Calculate the average speed of this protein in SI units. Round your answer to two significant figures.

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in {{ params_vars_units }}.
