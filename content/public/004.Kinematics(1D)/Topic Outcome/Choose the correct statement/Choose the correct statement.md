      title: Choose the Correct Statement
    part1:
      ans1:
        value: The particle's instantaneous velocity at $x = 0$ is zero.
      ans2:
        value: No information about the particle's velocity or acceleration can be
          found from its trajectory.
      ans3:
        value: The particle's instantaneous velocity at $x= 0$ points in either the
          $\hat{\imath}$ or the $-\hat{\imath}$ direction.
      ans4:
        value: The particle's instantaneous acceleration at $x= 0$ is zero.
      ans5:
        value: The particle's instantaneous velocity at $x= 0$ is positive.

<div id="desc">
<h5>Long Description of image: Figure of the particle's trajectory.</h5>
A cartesian plane is used. The particle starts at a point with a negative x-coordinate and a positive y-coordinate. The graph increases uniformly and then starts to increase at a slower rate until it crosses the y-axis in a horizontal line. From there, it starts to increase at an increasing rate until a uniform increase (a straight line) is reached.
