# {{ params.vars.title }}
In a demo for showing how a jet works, {{ params.vars.name }} would like to use an inflated balloon. The mass of the empty balloon is {{ params.m }} $g$ and it only moves vertically upward. We know that this balloon produces a constant thrust force of {{ params.F }} $N$.

## Part 1

What will be the speed of the balloon after it moves {{ params.d }} $m$ upward? Neglect air resistance and assume it starts from rest.

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in {{ params.vars.units }}.
