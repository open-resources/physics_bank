For this problem, refer to the following figure.

Top: The x-component of a velocity vs. time graph is shown for an object:

<img src="vgraph.png" alt= "The top graph is velocity vs time of an object where at t=0 the velocity is negative 1, from t=1 to t=1.5 the velocity is negative 2, at t=2 the velocity is 0. After t=2 the velocity continually increases." width = 500>

Bottom: Below are *possible* options of that same object's "acceleration vs. time" graph:

<img src="agraphs.png" alt="There are 5 graphs depicted below the velocity vs time graph. The 5 graphs depict acceleration vs time and are labelled A through E. Graph A is the same shape as the top graph. Graph B shows a negative acceleration from t=0 to t=1 and a positive acceleration from t=1.5 onwards. Graph C shows a positive acceleration from t=0 to t=1 and a negative acceleration from t=1.5 onwards. Graph D shows a negative acceleration curve that reaches the lowest at around t=2 and is 0 at t=3. Graph E shows increasing positive acceleration from t=0 to t=1, from t=1.5 and onwards the acceleration decreases." width=700>

## Part 1

Of the listed acceleration vs. time graphs shown in the bottom figure, which is consistent with the velocity vs. time graph shown in the top figure?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part1.ans1.value}}
- {{ params.part1.ans2.value}}
- {{ params.part1.ans3.value}}
- {{ params.part1.ans4.value}}
- {{ params.part1.ans5.value}}

## Part 2

If the initial position of the object whose velocity vs. time graph is shown in the figure (Top) is $x_0$ = 0 $m$, at what time does the object return to the position $x$ = 0 $m$ ?
