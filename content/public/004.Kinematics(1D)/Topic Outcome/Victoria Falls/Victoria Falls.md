# {{ params.vars.title }}
Victoria Falls  (or Mosi-oa-Tunga, "the smoke that thunders") is the world's tallest waterfall.  In the dry season it has a minimum volume rate of flow of 300 $m^3/s$, and splits into 5 waterfalls along its 1708 $m$ length.  The highest of these is called Rainbow Falls, standing 108 $m$ tall.

## Question Text

If {{ params.rate }} $m^3/s$ of water flows over Rainbow falls, by the time it reaches the bottom of Rainbow Falls, what cross-sectional area does this water have? (Please make the likely unreasonable assumptions that none of the water evapourates, and that it stays together as its area decreases).

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in {{ params.vars.units }}.
