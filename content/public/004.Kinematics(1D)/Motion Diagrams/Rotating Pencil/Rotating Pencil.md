<h5>Long Description of image: Motion diagram of a rotating pencil as it flies through the air.</h5>
The centre of mass of the pencil is marked by a dot throughout its motion through the air. The motion of the pencil has a shape similar to that of a parabola.
The motion diagram consists of seven dots numbered 0 to 6 and the dot numbered 3 is at the peak of the parabola.

## Part 1

Explain why the particle model that we use to draw motion diagrams cannot adequately represent the rotation of a pencil as it flies through the air as seen in the figure.
