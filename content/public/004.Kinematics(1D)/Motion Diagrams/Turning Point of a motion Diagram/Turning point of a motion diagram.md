    part1:
      ans1:
        value: When approaching a turning point, the spacing of dots decreases. Right
          at the turning point, the spacing is momentarily zero. Leaving a turning
          point, the spacing of dots increases.
      ans2:
        value: When approaching a turning point, the spacing of dots increases. Right
          at the turning point, the spacing is momentarily zero. Leaving a turning
          point, the spacing of dots decreases.
      ans3:
        value: When approaching a turning point, the spacing of dots decreases. Right
          at the turning point, the spacing is momentarily zero. Leaving a turning
          point, the spacing of dots decreases.
      ans4:
        value: When approaching a turning point, the spacing of dots increases. Right
          at the turning point, the spacing is momentarily zero. Leaving a turning
          point, the spacing of dots increases.
