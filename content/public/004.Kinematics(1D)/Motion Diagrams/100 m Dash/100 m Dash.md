# {{ params.vars.title }}
In the 100 $m$ dash sprinters speed up from rest for the first {{ params.d1 }} $m$, and maintain their speed for the final {{ params.d2 }} $m$.

## Part 1

Using the particle model, draw a set of dots on a reasonable coordinate system to represent this motion, take a picture, and upload your diagram.

Your file must be a pdf named "model.pdf".
