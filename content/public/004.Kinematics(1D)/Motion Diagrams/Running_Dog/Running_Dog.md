# {{ params.vars.title }}
Consider the following motion diagram for a dog running down a straight path.

![A displacement time graph showing the dog increasing by 2 meters from t equals 0 seconds to t equals 2 seconds. The dog is not moving from t equals 2 seconds to t equals 6 seconds. The dog decreases 2 meters from t equals 6 seconds to t equals 8 seconds. The dog decreases to negative 2 meters from t equals 8 second to t equals 10 seconds. The dog increases 2 meters from t equals 10 seconds to t equals 12 seconds.](Q1.png)
