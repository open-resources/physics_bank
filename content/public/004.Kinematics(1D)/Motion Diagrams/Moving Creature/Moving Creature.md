  substitutions:
    params_vars_title: Moving Creature
    params_part1_ans1_value: The creature is speeding up because the distance between
      points equally spaced in time is increasing.
    params_part1_ans2_value: The creature is slowing down because the distance between
      points equally spaced in time is increasing.
    params_part1_ans3_value: The creature is maintaining a constant speed because
      the distance between points equally spaced in time is increasing at a constant
      rate.
    params_part1_ans4_value: The creature is stationary because the points form a
      horizontal line.
    params_part2_ans1_value: The creature maintains a constant space because the distance
      between points equally spaced in time is constant.
    params_part2_ans2_value: The creature is stationary because the distance between
      points equally spaced in time is constant.
    params_part2_ans3_value: The creature is speeding up because the dots form a line
      with a positive slope.
    params_part2_ans4_value: The creature is slowing down because the dots form a
      line with a positive slope.
    params_part3_ans1_value: This could describe a loon or a duck accelerating across
      the surface of the water before taking flight at a constant speed, about 30$^{\circ}$
      above the water.
    params_part3_ans2_value: This could describe a loon or a duck flying at a constant
      speed across the surface of the water before taking flight with an increasing
      speed, about 30$^{\circ}$ above the water.
    params_part3_ans3_value: This could describe a loon or a duck at rest on the surface
      of the water before taking flight at a constant speed, about 30$^{\circ}$ above
      the water.
    params_part3_ans4_value: This could describe a loon or a duck at rest on the surface
      of the water before taking flight with an increasing speed, about 30$^{\circ}$
      above the water.

# {{ params_vars_title }}
A set of dots representing the position of a living creature is shown in the figure. The spots are equally spaced in time.

<img longdesc="Moving Creature.md#desc" alt="Motion diagram of the creature." src="livingcreature.png" width="500px">

<div id="desc">
<h5>Long Description of image: Motion diagram of the creature.</h5>
The motion diagram consists of seven dots numbered 0 to 6.
Dots 0 to 3 form a horizontal line with an increasing spacing between adjacent dots.
Dots 3 to 6 form a straight line with positive slope with an equal spacing between adjacent dots.
<p>Long description ends.</p>
