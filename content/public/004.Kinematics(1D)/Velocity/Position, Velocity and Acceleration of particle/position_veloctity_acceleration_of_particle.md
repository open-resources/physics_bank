# {{ params.vars.title }}
The velocity of a particle which moves along the X axis is given by $v = 4 - 8t + 10t^2$, where $t$ is in seconds
and $v$ is in $m/s$.
Find the following parameters when $t$={{params.t}} if the particle is at {{params.s0}}$m$ when $t$=0.

## Part 1

Find the position.

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $m$.

## Part 2

Find the velocity.

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $m/s$.

## Part 3

Find the acceleration.

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $m/s^2$.
