## Question Text

The graph above shows the movement of a ball, with its displacement, $s$, measured against its velocity, $v$.
A curve is drawn through the data points as shown.
Determine the acceleration of the ball when $s = {{params.s}}$.

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in {{ params.vars.units }}.
