The figure shows the graph of the position $x$ as a function of time for an object moving in a straight line (along the $x$-axis).

## Part 1

Which of the following graphs best describes the velocity along the $x$-axis as a function of time for this object?

<div id="desc">
<h5>Long Description of image: Figure of answer options.</h5>
All of the figures are velocity-time graphs.<br>
Figure a shows a graph which starts at a negative y-value and which increases at a decreasing rate. The graph does not cross the x-axis.<br>
Figure b shows a straight line which starts at a negative y-value and stops when it reaches the x-axis.<br>
Figure c shows a graph which starts at a negative y-value and which increases at a decreasing rate. The graph crosses the x-axis.<br>
Figure d shows a graph which starts at a positive y-value and which decreases at a decreasing rate.<br>
Figure e shows a straight line with a positive slope starting at the origin.
