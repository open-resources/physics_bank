# {{ params.vars.title }}
A ball is launched vertically from the ground with an initial speed of $v = {{ params.v }}$ $\rm{m/s}$.

## Part 1

What is the first time at which the ball is at a height of ${{ params.h }}$ $\rm{m}$?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $\rm{s}$.

## Part 2

Compute the velocity of the ball at $t_1$ (taking up to be positive).

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $\rm{m/s}$.

## Part 3

What is the second time at which the ball is at a height of ${{ params.h }}$ $\rm{m}$?

### Answer Section

- Please enter in a numeric value in $\rm{s}$.

## Part 4

Compute the velocity of the ball at $t_2$ (taking up to be positive).

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $\rm{m/s}$.
