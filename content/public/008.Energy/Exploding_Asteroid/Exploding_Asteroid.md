      title: Exploding Asteroid
      name: Mateo
      name2: Ahmed
    part1:
      ans1:
        value: The CHANGE in the momentum vector they determine for each piece of
          the asteroid before and after the explosion will be the same.
      ans2:
        value: The final velocity vectors they use to describe the two asteroid pieces
          will be the same.
      ans3:
        value: They will both agree on how the kinetic energy of each of the pieces
          has changed.
      ans4:
        value: The FORCE vector they determine that each piece of the asteroid felt
          during the explosion will be the same.
      ans5:
        value: They will both agree on how the internal energy of the system has changed.
      ans6:
        value: They will both agree on how the TOTAL kinetic energy of the system
          has changed.

## Question Text

{{ params.vars.name }} and {{ params.vars.name2 }} are both standing in their space ships, each one moving with a constant (but different) velocity. They carefully watch and measure, from their two space ships, an asteroid exploding into two parts. When they compare their final numbers, which of their numbers will agree?
