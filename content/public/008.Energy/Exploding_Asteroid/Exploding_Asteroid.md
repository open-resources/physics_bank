## Question Text

{{ params_vars_name }} and {{ params_vars_name2 }} are both standing in their spaceships, each one moving with a different constant velocity.
They carefully watch and measure, from their two spaceships, an asteroid exploding into two parts. Select the correct statement(s).

### Answer Section

Note: You will be awarded full marks only if you select all the correct choices and none of the incorrect choices.
