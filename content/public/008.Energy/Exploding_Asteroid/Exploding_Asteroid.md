      title: Exploding Asteroid
      name: Savannah
      name2: Aliyah
    part1:
      ans1:
        value: They will both agree on how the total kinetic energy of the system
          has changed.
      ans2:
        value: The final velocity vectors they use to describe the two asteroid pieces
          will be the same.
      ans3:
        value: The momentum vectors they use to describe each of the two asteroid
          pieces will be the same.
      ans4:
        value: The force vector they determine that each piece of the asteroid felt
          during the explosion will be the same.
      ans5:
        value: The final speeds they measure for the two asteroid pieces will be the
          same.
      ans6:
        value: They will both agree on how much kinetic energy each of the asteroid
          pieces has.

## Question Text

{{ params.vars.name }} and {{ params.vars.name2 }} are both standing in their spaceships, each one moving with a different constant velocity.
They carefully watch and measure, from their two spaceships, an asteroid exploding into two parts. Select the correct statement(s).

### Answer Section

Note: You will be awarded full marks only if you select all the correct choices and none of the incorrect choices.
Choosing incorrect choices as well as not choosing correct choices will result in deductions.
