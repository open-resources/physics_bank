      name: Abbas
      name2: Lorenzo
    part1:
      ans1:
        value: The final velocity vectors they use to describe the two asteroid pieces
          will be the same.
      ans2:
        value: The CHANGE in the momentum vector they determine for each piece of
          the asteroid before and after the explosion will be the same.
      ans3:
        value: They will both agree on how much kinetic energy each of the asteroid
          pieces has.
      ans4:
        value: The final speeds they measure for the two asteroid pieces will be the
          same.
      ans5:
        value: The momentum vectors they use to describe each of the two asteroid
          pieces will be the same.
      ans6:
        value: They will both agree on how the TOTAL kinetic energy of the system
          has changed.

## Question Text

{{ params.vars.name }} and {{ params.vars.name2 }} are both standing in their space ships, each one moving with a constant (but different) velocity. They carefully watch and measure, from their two space ships, an asteroid exploding into two parts. When they compare their final numbers, which of their numbers will agree?
