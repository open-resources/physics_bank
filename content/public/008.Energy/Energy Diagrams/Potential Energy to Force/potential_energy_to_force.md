## Part 1

The potential energy of a particle in a conservative one-dimensional potential as a function of position, $x$, is shown. Which figure represents the force as a function of position $x$ that acts on the particle?

<img src="q9.png" alt="Image of six graphs. One graph of potential as a function of position, which is a polynomial with two positive peaks, the first higher than the next. Option A is a graph of force vs position with the shape of the potential graph reflected on the x axis. Option B is a polynomial with two negative peaks below zero. Option C is identical to the potential graph. Option D is the same as optioin B but reflected over the x-axis. Option E is a piecewise function with a positive linear segment, negative linear segment, followed by another, less positive linear segment. ">
