Two springs in series are displaced at the point they connect by a maximum force of $F = {{params_F}}\ \rm{N}$, spring A has a spring coefficient of $k_1 = {{params_k1}} \ \rm{N/m}$ and spring B has a spring coefficient of $k_2 = {{params_k2}} \ \rm{N/m}$.

## Part 1

What is the total energy in the system? Ignore gravitational potential energy and consider that the springs are fixed at the ends.

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $\rm{J}$.
