      part1:
        ans1:
          value: Increases, because the block now has more stored elastic potential
            energy initially.
        ans2:
          value: Decreases, because a greater stiffness constant results in a larger
            decelerating force, hence the new spring can do the same negative work
            in a shorter distance.
        ans3:
          value: No change, because the increased initial stored potential energy
            is offset by the greater amount of negative work done.

# Block attached to Spring
A block of mass $m$ attached to a linear spring with spring constant $k$ and an un-stretched length of $3R/2 m$ is held at equilibrium in the position shown below and then released from rest.

## Part 1

If the spring stiffness constant is increased, does the maximum horizontal displacement of the block increase or decrease?
