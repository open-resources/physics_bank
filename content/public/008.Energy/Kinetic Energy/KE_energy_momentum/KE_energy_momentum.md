      title: Kinetic Energy and Momentum
    part1:
      ans1:
        value: If I throw an object straight up (vertically) in the air, its kinetic
          energy at the highest point will be zero.
      ans2:
        value: If I throw an object diagonally up in the air, its kinetic energy at
          the highest point will be zero.
      ans3:
        value: If I throw an object diagonally up in the air, its momentum at the
          highest point will be zero.
      ans4:
        value: If I throw an object into the air, the system composed of the object
          and the earth is a CLOSED system.
