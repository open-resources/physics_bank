A spring between a collar and fixed point has an unstretched length of ${{params.xi}}m$ and a stiffness of ${{params.k}}N/m$.
The ${{params.m}}kg$ collar is released from rest at A and slides down a curve with radius $R = {{params.R}}m$.
Calculate the velocity of the slider as it reaches B, $x = {{params.x}}m$ away from the curve, if there is no friction.

## Part 1

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $m/s$.
