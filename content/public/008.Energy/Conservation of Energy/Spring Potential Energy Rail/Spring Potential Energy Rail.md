As a roller coaster approaches the station in the vertical plane, approaching its final drop. A spring attaches to the cart to slow it. The spring has an unstretched length of ${{params.xi}}m$ and a stiffness of ${{params.k}}N/m$.
The ${{params.m}}kg$ cart experiences its final drop from rest at A, and the track is a curve with radius $R = {{params.R}}m$.
Calculate the velocity of the cart as it reaches its station at B, $x = {{params.x}}m$ away from the curve, if there is no friction.

## Part 1

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $m/s$.
