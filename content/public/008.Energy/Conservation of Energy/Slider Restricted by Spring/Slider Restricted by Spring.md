The ${{params.m}}-kg$ slider at A is mounted on a horizontal rail with negligible friction.
It is acted upon by a constant force of ${{params.F}}N$ via a cable as shown.
The slider is released from rest at A, with the spring it is attached to extended by an initial amount ${{params.x1}}m$.
The spring stiffness is $k = {{params.k}} N/m$.
Calculate the velocity of the block when it reaches point B, $d = {{params.d}}m$ away. Assume $h = {{params.h}}m$.

Please enter in a numeric value in $m/s$.
