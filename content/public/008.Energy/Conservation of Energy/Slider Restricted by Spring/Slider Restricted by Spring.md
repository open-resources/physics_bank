The {{params.m}} $kg$ slider at A is mounted on a horizontal rail with negligible friction.
It is acted upon by a constant force of {{params.F}} $N$ via a cable as shown.
The slider is released from rest at A, with the spring it is attached to extended by an initial amount {{params.x1}} $m$.
The spring stiffness is $k =$ {{params.k}} $N/m$.
Calculate the velocity of the block when it reaches point B, $d =$ {{params.d}} $m$ away. Assume $h =$ {{params.h}} $m$.

## Part 1

Please enter in a numeric value in $m/s$.
