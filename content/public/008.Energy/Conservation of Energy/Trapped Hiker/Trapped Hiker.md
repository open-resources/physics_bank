A hiker is trapped in a tunnel after a minor rockslide.
A rescue helicopter arrived and lowered a pulley to help them escape.
The ${{params_m}}kg$ hiker is pulled up through an opening, without touching the walls (No friction).
A bungee cord from their pack sticks to them, acting as a spring with a stiffness of ${{params_k}}N/m$ and is stretched ${{params_x1}}m$ at A, where the hiker is initially pulled from rest.
The $F = {{params_F}}N$ force over a pulley is constantly pulling the hiker free. Calculate the velocity as they passes point C.
$\theta=${{params_thetad}}$^\circ$,$d = {{params_d}}m$,and $h = {{params_h}}m$.
