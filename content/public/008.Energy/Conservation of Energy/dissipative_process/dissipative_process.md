      title: Dissipative Energy
    part1:
      ans1:
        value: Irreversible processes are dissipative.
      ans2:
        value: Dissipative processes are one where the total mechanical energy is
          not conserved.
      ans3:
        value: Incoherent deformations are dissipative
      ans4:
        value: If the total kinetic energy is not constant all of the way through
          the interaction, the process is dissipative.
      ans5:
        value: Coherent deformations are dissipative.
