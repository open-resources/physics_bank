# {{ params.vars.title }}
A {{params.m_1}} $\rm{g}$ rubber ball is tied to a {{params.l}} meter long string and released from rest at angle $\theta$.
It swings down and at the very bottom has a perfectly elastic collision with a {{params.m_2}} $\rm{kg}$ block.
The block is resting on a frictionless surface and is connected to a {{params.spring}} cm long spring of spring constant
{{params.k}} $\rm{N/m}$.
After the collision, the spring compresses a maximum distance of {{params.x}} $\rm{cm}$.

When the ball is released and the string becomes perpindicular to the roof, it will hit a block. There is a spring on the opposite side of the block that compresses when the ball hits the block." width=400>

## Part 1

From what angle was the rubber ball released?
