    part1:
      ans1:
        value: It depends on the horizontal location of the U-shaped dip.It is not
          possible to predict this with 100% certainty.
      ans2:
        value: It depends on the height of the dip.
      ans3:
        value: They reach the end of the track at the same time.
      ans4:
        value: Ball B will reach the end of the track first.
      ans5:
        value: Ball A will reach the end of the track first.

# {{ params.vars.title }}
Two identical balls, Ball A and Ball B are launched with the same initial velocity $v$ along a pair of tracks.
The first track with Ball A, is a straight track.
The second track with Ball B, has a "U"-shaped dip in the middle so the ball goes down and then back up.
