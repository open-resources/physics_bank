# {{ params_vars_title }}
A curler is practicing for the national curling championships to get the perfect momentum and strength on the push of a curling rock. The rock has a mass of $m = {{ params_m }} \ \rm{kg}$ and hits a spring target at the end. Find the work done by the spring, and the speed of the rock when it reached the spring, if the spring constant is $k = {{ params_k }} \ \rm{N/m}$ and the spring compresses $d = {{ params_d }} \ \rm{cm}$. The coefficient of friction on rough ice sheet is $\mu = {{ params_mu }}$.

## Part 1

What is the work done by the spring?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in {{ params_vars_units }}.

## Part 2

With what velocity does the rock impact the spring?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $\ \rm{m/s^2}$.
