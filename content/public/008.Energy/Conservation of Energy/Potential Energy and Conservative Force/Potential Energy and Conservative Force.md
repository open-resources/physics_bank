      title: Potential Energy and Conservative Force
    part1:
      ans1:
        value: The net force on the particle is also zero.
      ans2:
        value: The slope of the force versus position graph is zero at that point.
      ans3:
        value: This does not allow us to determine the force at this point, nor the
          slope of the force versus position graph at this point.
      ans4:
        value: The net force on the particle is positive.
      ans5:
        value: The net force on the particle is negative.

## Part 1

A particle is acted on only by a conservative force. If the potential energy of this particle is zero at some point, then:

(*Hint: draw a PE versus distance diagram--is there more than one way to satisfy PE = 0, and what does this mean about the conservative force?*)
