A rocket racer toy, $m = {{ params.m }} kg$ is sent down a track from $A$ to $B$ separated by a height $h = {{ params.h }} m$ and a distance $d = {{ params.d }} m$ as shown.
If the racer has a velocity of ${{ params.va }} m/s$ down the incline at $A$ and a velocity of ${{ params.vb }} m/s$ away from the incline at $B$, what is the work done by friction from A to B?
