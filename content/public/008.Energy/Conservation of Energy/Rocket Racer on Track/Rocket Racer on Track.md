# {{ params.vars.title }}
A rocket racer toy of mass $m = {{ params.m }} kg$ is sent down a track from $A$ to $B$ from a height $h = {{ params.h }} m$ and a horizontal distance $d = {{ params.d }} m$ away from point B as shown in the diagram below.
If the toy has a velocity of ${{ params.va }} m/s$ down the incline at point $A$, and a velocity of ${{ params.vb }} m/s$ at point $B$, what is the work done by friction as the toy moves from point A to point B?
