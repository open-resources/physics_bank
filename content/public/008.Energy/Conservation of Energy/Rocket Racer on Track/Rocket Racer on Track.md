# {{ params_vars_title }}
A rocket racer toy of mass $m = {{ params_m }} kg$ is sent down a track from $A$ to $B$ from a height $h = {{ params_h }} m$ and a horizontal distance $d = {{ params_d }} m$ away from point B as shown in the diagram below.
If the toy has a velocity of ${{ params_va }} m/s$ down the incline at point $A$, and a velocity of ${{ params_vb }} m/s$ at point $B$, what is the work done by friction as the toy moves from point A to point B?
