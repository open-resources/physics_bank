      title: Two Waterslide Paths
    part1:
      ans1:
        value: riders will arrive at the end of their slide with a greater final speed
          along path (i) than along path (ii).
      ans2:
        value: riders will arrive at the same speed at the end of their slide regardless
          of which track they choose.
      ans3:
        value: riders will arrive at the end of their slide with a greater final speed
          along path (ii) than along path (i).
      ans4:
        value: riders will not reach the end of their slide as they will fly off the
          sides of the track regardless of which track they choose.
      ans5:
        value: riders will not reach the end of their slide along path (ii) as they
          will not be able to get over the hill.

## Part 1

If riders experience no friction and no drag along both paths, then
