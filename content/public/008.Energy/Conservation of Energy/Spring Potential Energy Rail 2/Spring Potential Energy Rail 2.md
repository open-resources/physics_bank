Consider the above figure. A rollercoaster takes a completely vertical drop. A massless spring of stiffness $k = {{params.k}} N/m$ is attaches to a rollercoaster, $m = {{params.m}} kg$, as it rounds a bend. The coaster slides without friction on a rail of radius $R = {{params.R}} m$. Assume $v$ = 0 as it enters the drop at $A$ and the spring is unstretched when the coaster passes $B$, answer the following questions.

## Part 1

What is the velocity of the cart when it is at $B$?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $m/s$.

## Part 2

What is the velocity of the cart when it is at $C$?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $m/s$.

## Part 3

What is the normal force on the cart when it is at the bottom of the bend?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $N$.
