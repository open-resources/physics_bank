Consider the above figure. A massless spring of stiffness $k = {{params.k}} N/m$ is connected between a fixed point and a collar of mass $m = {{params.m}} kg$. The collar slides without friction on a rail of radius $R = {{params.R}} m$. If the collar is released from rest at $A$ and the spring is unstretched when the collar passes $B$, answer the following questions.

## Part 1

What is the velocity of the collar when it is at $B$?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $m/s$.

## Part 2

What is the velocity of the collar when it is at $C$?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $m/s$.

## Part 3

What is the normal force on the collar when it is at $C$?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $N$.
