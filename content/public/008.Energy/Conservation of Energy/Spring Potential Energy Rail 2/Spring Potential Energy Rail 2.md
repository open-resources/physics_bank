With the given information, answer the following quetsions.
Neglect friction, assume R =  {{params.R}} m, m = {{params.m}}kg, and k = {{params.k}}N/m.
The spring is unstretched as it passes point B.

## Part 1

As the slider is released and slides down the track, what is its velocity at point B?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $m/s$.

## Part 2

As the slider is released and slides down the track, what is its velocity at point C?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $m/s$.

## Part 3

What is its normal force at C?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in $N$.
