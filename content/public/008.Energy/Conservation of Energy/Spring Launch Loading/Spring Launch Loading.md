The {{params_m}} $kg$ projectile is loaded into a spring launcher using a string for a game.
It is acted upon by a constant force of {{params_F}} $N$ via a cable as shown.
The projectile begins at rest at A, with the spring it is attached to compressed by an initial amount {{params_x1}} $m$.
The spring stiffness is $k =$ {{params_k}} $N/m$.
Calculate the velocity of the block when it reaches point B, $d =$ {{params_d}} $m$ away. Assume $h =$ {{params_h}} $m$.

## Part 1

Please enter in a numeric value in $m/s$.
