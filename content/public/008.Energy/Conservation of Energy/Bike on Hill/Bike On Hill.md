The two tires of a bike are connected by a massless carbon fibre frame.
If they are released from rest as shown, and slide along the bottom of the ramp with radius of curvature $R = {{params.R}} cm$, calculate the velocity of the bike when the tire at $A$ reaches $B$ and the tire at $B$ reaches $B^{\prime}$.
