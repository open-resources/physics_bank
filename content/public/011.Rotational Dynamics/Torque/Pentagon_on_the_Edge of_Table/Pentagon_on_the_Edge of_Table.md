      part1:
        ans1:
          value: ' The gravitational torque is non-zero about the corner of the table'
          feedback: Great! You got it.
        ans2:
          value: ' The gravitational torque is zero about the corner of the table'
          feedback: Does this torque cause rotation?
      part2:
        ans1:
          value: Negative (clockwise)
          feedback: Great! You got it. The gravitational torque causes clockwise rotation.
        ans2:
          value: Positive (counter-clockwise)
          feedback: The direction of the net torque points down which causes clockwise
            rotation(negative torque).
        ans3:
          value: The gravitational torque is zero about the corner of the table.
          feedback: Does this torque cause rotation?
