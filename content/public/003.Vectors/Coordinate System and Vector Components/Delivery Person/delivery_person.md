# {{ params_vars_title }}
A delivery person starts at the post office, drives {{params_dist1}} km north, then {{params_dist2}} km west, then {{params_dist3}} km northeast, and finally {{params_dist4}} km north to stop for lunch.

Assume $+y$ is to the North, and $+x$ is to the East.

Determine the following quantities:

## Part 1

Find the x component of their net displacement vector.

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in {{ params_vars_units }}.

## Part 2

Find the y component of their net displacement vector.

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in {{ params_vars_units }}.

## Part 3

How far is the shortest path from the post office to the restaurant?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in {{ params_vars_units }}.

## Part 4

If the delivery person returns from the restaurant to the post office, what is the **x component** of their displacement vector on this return trip?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in {{ params_vars_units }}.

## Part 5

If the delivery person returns from the restaurant to the post office, what is the **y component** of their displacement vector on this return trip?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in {{ params_vars_units }}.

## Part 6

If the delivery person returns from the restaurant to the post office, what direction is their heading on this return trip? *Pay close attention to how the positive direction of the angle is labeled in the input box.*

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in {{ params_vars_units }}.
