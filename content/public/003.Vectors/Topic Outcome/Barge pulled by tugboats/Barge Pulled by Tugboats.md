# {{ params_vars_title }}
A barge is pulled by the two tugboats shown in the following figure.
One tugboat pulls on the barge with a force of magnitude $F_2 = $ {{ params_F2 }} units of force at $\theta_2 = $ {{ params.theta_2 }}$^{\circ}$ above the line AB and the other tugboat pulls on the barge with a force of magnitude $F_1 = $ {{ params_F1 }} units of force at $\theta_1 = $ {{ params.theta_1 }}$^{\circ}$ below the line AB.

Assume $+y$ is straight ahead, and $+x$ is to the right.

<h5>Figure of a barge pulled by two tugboats.</h5>
A straight line AB is drawn through the center of the barge.
One tugboat pulls the barge to the left with a force of magnitude $F_1$ at an angle $\theta_1$ relative to AB.
The other tugboat pulls to the right with a force $F_2$ at angle $\theta_2$ relative to AB.

## Part 1

Resolve the pulling forces to their components.
What is the $x$-component of the right-force (i.e. $F_2$)?
Remember to consider the sign convention.

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in 'units of force'.

## Part 2

Resolve the pulling forces to their components.
What is the $y$-component of the right-force (i.e. $F_2$)?
Remember to consider the sign convention.

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in 'units of force'.

## Part 3

Resolve the pulling forces to their components.
What is the $x$-component of the left-force (i.e. $F_1$)?
