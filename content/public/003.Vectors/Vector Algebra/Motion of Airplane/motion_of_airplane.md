# {{ params.vars.title }}
A small plane flies {{params.v1}} km in a direction {{params.a1}} degrees {{params.dir1}} of east and then flies {{params.v2}} km in a direction {{params.a2}} degrees north of east.

## Part 1

Use a graphical method to find the total distance the plane covers from the starting point and the direction of the path to the final position.
