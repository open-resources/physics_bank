# {{ params_vars_title }}
An asteroid is captured in space by a shuttle crew, looking for rare earth metals. The shuttle is orbiting earth at an altitude of $h = {{ params_h }} \ \rm{mi}$ above the surface of the earth. When the crew weighs the asteroid, it comes up as $W = {{ params_W }}$ $\rm{lb}$.
Take the radius of the earth to be $R\_{earth} = 3,959 \ \rm{mi}$

## Part 1

What is the mass of the asteroid in kg?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in {{ params_vars_units }}.
