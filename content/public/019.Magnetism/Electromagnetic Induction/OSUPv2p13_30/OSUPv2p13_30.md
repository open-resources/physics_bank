## Question Text

A long solenoid with $n$ = ${{params.n }}$ turns per centimeter has a cross-sectional area of ${{params.A }} \rm\ cm^2$ and carries a current of ${{params.I }}\textrm{ A}$. A coil with ${{params.N }}$ turns encircles the solenoid. When the current through the solenoid is turned off, it decreases to zero in ${{params.t }}\textrm{ s}$. What is the average emf induced in the coil?
