## Question Text

A long solenoid with $n$ = {{params.n }} turns per centimeter has a cross-sectional area of {{params.A }} $\rm\ cm^2$ and carries a current of {{params.I }} $\textrm{A}$. A coil with {{params.N }} turns encircles the solenoid. When the current through the solenoid is turned off, it decreases to zero in {{params.t }} $\textrm{ s}$. What is the average emf induced in the coil?
