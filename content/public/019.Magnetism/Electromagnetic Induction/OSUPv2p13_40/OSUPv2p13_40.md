## Question Text

A coil of ${{params.N }}$ turns encloses an area of ${{params.a }}\rm\ {cm^2}$. It is rotated in ${{params.t }}\textrm{ s}$ from a position where its plane is perpendicular to Earth's magnetic field to one where its plane is parallel to the field. If the strength of the field is ${{params.B }} \times 10^{-5} \textrm{ T}$ what is the average emf induced in the coil?
