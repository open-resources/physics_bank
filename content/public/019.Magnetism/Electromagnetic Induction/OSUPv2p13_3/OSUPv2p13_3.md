    params_part1_ans1_value: Both rings have the same induced electric fields; the
      copper ring has a much higher induced emf than the wooden ring.
    params_part1_ans2_value: Both rings have the same induced electric fields; the
      wooden ring has a much higher induced emf than the copper ring.
    params_part1_ans3_value: The copper ring has a much higher induced electric field
      and induced emf than the wooden ring.
    params_part1_ans4_value: The wooden ring has a much higher induced electric field
      and induced emf than the copper ring.
    params_part1_ans5_value: The copper ring and wooden ring have the same induced
      electric fields and induced emf.

## Part 1

A copper ring and a wooden ring of the same dimensions are placed in magnetic fields so that there is the same change in magnetic flux through them. Compare the induced electric field and the induced emf in the different rings.
