      title: Copper and Wooden Rings
    part1:
      ans1:
        value: Both rings have the same induced electric fields; the copper ring has
          a much higher induced emf than the wooden ring.
      ans2:
        value: Both rings have the same induced electric fields; the wooden ring has
          a much higher induced emf than the copper ring.
      ans3:
        value: The copper ring has a much higher induced electric field and induced
          emf than the wooden ring.
      ans4:
        value: The wooden ring has a much higher induced electric field and induced
          emf than the copper ring.
      ans5:
        value: The copper ring and wooden ring have the same induced electric fields
          and induced emf.

## Part 1

A copper ring and a wooden ring of the same dimensions are placed in magnetic fields so that there is the same change in magnetic flux through them. Compare the induced electric field and the induced emf in the different rings.
