## Part 1

As the conducting ring enters the magnetic field, $\textrm{(a)}$, what direction is the induced current, if any, flowing through the ring?

### Answer Section

- {{ params_part1_ans1_value }}
- {{ params_part1_ans2_value }}
- {{ params_part1_ans3_value }}

## Part 2

When the conducting ring is fully inside the magnetic field, $\textrm{(b)}$, what direction is the induced current, if any, flowing through the ring?

### Answer Section

- {{ params_part2_ans1_value }}
- {{ params_part2_ans2_value }}
- {{ params_part2_ans3_value }}

## Part 3

As the conducting ring exits the magnetic field, $\textrm{(c)}$, what direction is the induced current, if any, flowing through the ring?

### Answer Section

- {{ params_part3_ans1_value }}
- {{ params_part3_ans2_value }}
- {{ params_part3_ans3_value }}
