At a given instant, an electron and a proton are moving with the same velocity in a constant magnetic field.

## Part 1

Compare the magnetic forces on these particles.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part1.ans1.value}}
- {{ params.part1.ans2.value}}
- {{ params.part1.ans3.value}}
- {{ params.part1.ans4.value}}

## Part 2

Compare their accelerations.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part2.ans1.value}}
- {{ params.part2.ans2.value}}
- {{ params.part2.ans3.value}}
- {{ params.part2.ans4.value}}

(1)The magnitude of the proton and electron magnetic forces are the same since they have the same amount of charge. The direction of these forces however are opposite of each other.

<p></p>
(2)The accelerations are opposite in direction and the electron has a larger acceleration than the proton due to its smaller mass.
