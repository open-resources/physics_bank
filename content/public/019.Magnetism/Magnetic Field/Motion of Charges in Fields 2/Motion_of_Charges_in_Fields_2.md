# {{ params.vars.title }}
Consider the charge $q\<0$ moving in a constant electric field $\vec{E}$ as shown below.

<img src="MotionOfCharge2.png" width=400 alt="On the left is a diagram of a negative charge moving to the right in an electric field that points up the page. On the right are arrows representative of the charge's possible trajectories. The arrow for option a points straight up. The arrow for option b starts pointing to the right and bends parabolically upward. The arrow for option c points straight to the right. The arrow for option d starts pointing to the right and bends parabollically downward. The arrow for option e points straight down.">

## Part 1
