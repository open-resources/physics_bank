    params_part1_ans2_feedback: Yes, the right hand rule tells us that the magnetic
      field acting on a positively charged particle creates an upward force acting
      on a particle initially moving to the right. This initially creates what looks
      like parabolic motion, although it will ultimately result in circular motion.

# {{ params_vars_title }}
Consider the charge $q>0$ moving in a constant magnetic field $\vec{B}$ as shown below.

## Part 1

Choose the correct path that the particle follows.

On the right are arrows representative of the charge's possible trajectories. The arrow for option a points straight up. The arrow for option b starts pointing to the right and bends parabolically upward. The arrow for option c points straight to the right. The arrow for option d starts pointing to the right and bends parabollically downward. The arrow for option e points straight down.">
