# {{ params.vars.title }}
A long, straight, horizontal wire carries a left-to-right current of {{ params.I }}$\rm\ A$.The wire is placed in a uniform magnetic field of magnitude {{ params.Bext }}$~\mu\mathrm{T}$ that is directed vertically downward.

## Question Text

What is the magnitude of the net magnetic field {{ params.d }}$\rm\ cm$ above the wire?
