# {{ params.vars.title }}
A circuit with current $I$ has two long parallel wire sections that carry current in opposite directions.
Find expressions for the $x$- and $y$-components of the magnetic field at point P which is a distance $a$ from one wire and $b$ from the other wire, as shown in the figure.
