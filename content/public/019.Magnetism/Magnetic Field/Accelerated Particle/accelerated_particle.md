## Question Text

A particle of charge $q$ and mass $m$ is accelerated from rest through a potential difference $V$, after which it encounters a uniform magnetic field $B$.
If the particle moves in a plane perpendicular to $B$, what is the radius of its circular orbit?

### Answer Section

Enter your expression in terms of $m$, $B$, $q$, and $V$:
