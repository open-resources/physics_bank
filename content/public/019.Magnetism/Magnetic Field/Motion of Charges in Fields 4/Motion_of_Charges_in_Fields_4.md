# {{ params_vars_title }}
Consider the charge $q>0$ moving in a constant electric field $\vec{E}$ as shown below.

<img src="MotionOfCharge4.png" width=400 alt="On the left is a diagram of a positive charge moving up and to the right in a magnetic field that points up the page. On the right are arrows representative of the charge's possible trajectories. The arrow for option a starts pointing up and to the right and bends parabolically upward. The arrow for option b shows a spiral trajectory. The charge moves up the page and rotates counterclockwise as seen by an observer looking down the page. The arrow for option c shows a spiral trajectory. The charge moves up the page and rotates clockwise as seen by an observer looking down the page. The arrow for option d shows a circular trajectory. The charge rotates counterclockwise as seen by an observer looking down the page. The arrow for option e starts pointing up and to the right and bends parabolically downward.">

## Part 1
