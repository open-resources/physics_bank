# {{ params.vars.title }}
An oxygen-16 ion with a mass of $2.66 \times 10^{-26} \textrm{ kg}$ travels at ${{params.v}} \times 10^{6} \textrm{ m/s}$ perpendicular to a ${{params.B}} \textrm{ T}$ magnetic field, which makes it move in a circular arc with a ${{params.r}} \textrm{ m}$ radius.

## Part 1

What positive charge is on the ion?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value.

## Part 2

What is the ratio of this charge to the charge of an electron?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value.
