## Question Text

A charged particle moves through a velocity selector at constant velocity. In the selector, $ E = {{params.E}} \times 10^{4}\textrm{ N/C}$ and $B = {{params.B}}\textrm{ T}$.
When the electric field is turned off, the charged particle travels in a circular path of radius ${{params.r}}\textrm{ mm}$. Determine the charge-to-mass ratio of the particle.
