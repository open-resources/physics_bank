## 2.mu
A wheel initially rotating at 62 rpm experiences the angular acceleration shown in The figure is an angular acceleration alpha versus time t graph. 
Alpha is measured in radians per squared second on the ordinate axis and t is measured in seconds on the abscissa axis. Alpha is equal to 0 from 0 to 1 seconds. 
Then it increases linearly to 4 radians per squared second by 2 seconds, and decreases linearly back to 0 by 3 seconds.

What is the wheel's angular velocity, in rpm, at t = 3.0 s?

Express your answer in rpm.

You are watching an archery tournament when you start wondering how fast an arrow is shot from the bow. Remembering your physics, 
you ask one of the archers to shoot an arrow parallel to the ground.
You find the arrow stuck in the ground 50.0 m away, making a 2.00 âˆ˜ angle with the ground.

How fast was the arrow shot?

Express your answer in m/s.

Your 64-cm-diameter car tire is rotating at 3.3 rev/s when suddenly you press down hard on the accelerator.
After traveling 180 m, the tire's rotation has increased to 5.7 rev/s.

What was the tire's angular acceleration? Give your answer in rad/s^2.

Express your answer in rad/s^2.
