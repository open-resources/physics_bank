## 3.xi
Object A has a position as a function of time given by rA(t) = (3.00 m/s)t i + (1.00 m/s^2)t^2 j. Object B has a position as a function of time given by 
rB(t) = (4.00 m/s)t i + (−1.00 m/s^2)t^2 j. All quantities are SI units. What is the distance between object A and object B at time t = 4.00 s?

## 4.omikron
A child throws a ball with an initial speed of 8.00 m/s at an angle of 40.0° above the horizontal. 
The ball leaves her hand 1.00 m above the ground and experience negligible air resistance.
