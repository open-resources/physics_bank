## 5.pi
A rubber ball is dropped onto a ramp that is tilted at 20 ∘ , as shown in the figureA figure shows a ball bouncing down a slope tilted at a 20 degrees angle with respect to 
the horizontal. The ball falls straight then bounces sideways and travels a horizontal distance of 3 meters on its first bounce. . 
A bouncing ball obeys the "law of reflection," which says that the ball leaves the surface at the same angle it approached the surface. 
The ball's next bounce is 3.0 m to the right of its first bounce.
