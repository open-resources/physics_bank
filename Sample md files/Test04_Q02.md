## 1.lambda
A plane flying at 70.0 m/s suddenly stalls. If the acceleration during the stall is 9.8 m/s2 directly downward, the stall lasts 5.0 s, 
and the plane was originally climbing at 25° to the horizontal, what is the velocity after the stall?

* 80 m/s at 37° above the horizontal
* 80 m/s at 37° below the horizontal
* 66 m/s at 17° above the horizontal
* 66 m/s at 17° below the horizontal

## 2.mu
A projectile is fired from point O at the edge of a cliff, with initial velocity components of v0x=60.0 m/s and v0y=175 m/s, as shown in the figure.
The projectile rises and then falls into the sea at point P. The time of flight of the projectile is 40.0 s, and it experiences no appreciable air resistance in flight.
What is the magnitude of the velocity of the projectile 21.0 s after it is fired?

## 5.pi
A small boat is moving at a velocity of 1.22 m/s when it is accelerated by a river current perpendicular to the initial direction of motion. 
If the acceleration of the current is 0.750 m/s2, what will be the new velocity of the boat after 12.2 s?

* 84.6 m/s at 82.4° from initial direction of motion
* 84.6 m/s at 7.59° from initial direction of motion
* 9.2 m/s at 7.59° from initial direction of motion
* 9.2 m/s at 82.4° from initial direction of motion
