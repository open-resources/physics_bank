#### **Dr. Firas Moosvi**

Firas Moosvi is a Lecturer at UBC Okanagan in the Computer Science, Math, Physics, and Statistics department. He teaches courses in Physics, Data Science, and Computer Science at the undergraduate and graduate levels. He has many research interests and they fall under three main umbrellas: medical imaging for applications in cancer, scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL), and learning analytics. Most recently, he is looking at how the field of learning analytics can provide insight to surface and reduce inequities in STEM programs. Firas has a deep appreciation for data visualization, active learning, and open source projects.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

#### **Graham Bovett**

I am a 3rd year Comp Sci student at UBCO. I am looking forward to specializing in AI and machine learning in my future courses and through co-op placements. Outside of school, I enjoy hiking, camping, snowboarding, and sailing. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<img align="left" width="150" height="150" style="padding-right: 20px" src="../images/ava.png"> </img>

#### **Ava Cornell**

I am a fourth year honours physics student at UBC Okanagan. Throughout my degree, I have thoroughly enjoyed being a physics teaching assistant and tutor, which has caused me to develop an interest in making learning more accessible and less stressful for students. In my free time, I like to hike, camp, and socialize. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<img align="left" width="150" height="150" style="padding-right: 20px" src="../images/abby.png"> </img>

#### **Abby Kiehlbauch**

I am a first year Bachelor of Arts student at UBCO planning to major in Computer Science. As it is my first year I don't have a specific area of interest, however my passions have always been mental health advocacy and social justice - I hope to find a way in which Computer Science can elevate those two fields. I am looking forward to further exploring the field of Computer Science in my next three years at UBCO. While I'm not studying or spending my days on Zoom I am usually reading, sewing, crocheting, or baking! <br><br><br><br><br>

<img align="left" width="150" height="150" style="padding-right: 20px" src="../images/maya.png"> </img> 

#### **Maya Patel**

I am a third year physics student at UBCO. I am passionate about physics education and hoping to pursue a masters after I graduate. I have always loved teaching and I was excited about this opportunity to make physics education more accessible. When I am not studying, you can find me hiking, skiing or rock climbing. <br><br><br><br><br>

#### **Akshat Poddar**

I am a 2nd year undergraduate student at UBC. My interests lie in the fields of Computer Science and Mathematics and I spend my time making myself more proficient in these disciplines. When I am not busy learning new technologies and frameworks, I spend most of my time on YouTube. I love to sing, cruise around on my skateboard, and enjoy a good game of the Settlers of Catan.  <br><br><br><br><br>

#### **Parsa Rajabi**

I am a 5th year Computer Science student with a background in Project Management, DevOps, Software Development, and research. I have a strong passion for Computer Science Education, Computational Thinking within K-12 Education and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Aside from doing research and teaching, I spend my spare time cooking, traveling, hiking and volunteering in the community / on campus!

#### **Vanshika Sharma**

I am a third year combined honours physics and astronomy student at UBC. Having taught science and math to special needs students over the past couple of years, I have developed a profound interest in science education and specifically making learning more accessible. Therefore, I am both excited and honoured to be part of this project! Academically, my interest lies in astrophysics but apart from that you can catch me hiking, food hopping, rewatching the same five tv shows or at the gym.  <br><br><br><br><br><br>

#### **Joseph Wandinger**

I am a fifth-year B.Sc. student at UBC Okanagan pursuing honours in physics and a minor in mathematics. I have always been passionate about making physics education more accessible to everyone, so I am excited to be a part of this project. In my research and honours thesis, I have investigated mid-range wireless power transfer using inductively-coupled loop-gap resonators. Outside of my academic pursuits, I am a student pilot of fixed-wing aircraft and I am pursuing my private pilot licence. In my spare time, I enjoy waterskiing, snowboarding, and playing music. <br><br><br><br><br><br>
