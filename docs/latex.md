# Using LaTeX in problems

## What is LaTeX?

LaTeX is a markup language that allows you to format the appearance of a document using specific syntax.
In our project you will mostly be using it to typset mathematical formulas. Markdown supports LaTeX, you just need to surround it with $___$.

## Table of Math Symbols

Here is a table of the main mathematical symbols you will be using.

## Examples

To capitalize a greek letter, you just need to capitalize the first letter of it in LaTeX.

Ex:

> \alpha and \Alpha

To create a fraction of LaTeX symbols, you can simply insert the symbols you need into the fraction function

Ex:

> \frac{\alpha}{\theta\pi}

You can add LaTeX anywhere into your markdown code, as long as you surround it with $...$
