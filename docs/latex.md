# Using LaTeX in problems

## What is LaTeX?

LaTeX is a markup language that allows you to format the appearance of a document using specific syntax.
In our project you will mostly be using it to typset mathematical formulas. Markdown supports LaTeX, you just need to surround it with `$___$`.

## Table of Math Symbols

Here is a table of the main mathematical symbols you will be using.

## Examples

To capitalize a greek letter, you just need to capitalize the first letter of it in LaTeX.

Ex:

> \alpha and \Alpha

To create a fraction of LaTeX symbols, you can simply insert the symbols you need into the fraction function

Ex:

> \frac{\alpha}{\theta\pi}

You can add LaTeX anywhere into your markdown code, as long as you surround it with $...$

> The block travels on an incline of 30$^{\circ}$.

For superscripts:

> $3^4$ should be \$3^4\$

> $3^{-4}$ should be \$3^{-4}\$ since more than one character is being used in the superscript

## Issues with LaTeX

LaTeX code might sometimes not render properly on PL.
Most of the time, using two back slashes instead of one will solve the issue.

Some examples:

| Issue | Fix |
| -- | -- |
| ```\frac{}{}``` | Use ```\dfrac{}{}``` or ```\\frac{}{}```|
| ```\theta``` | ```\\theta``` |
| ```\vec{}``` | ```\\vec{}``` |

Furthermore, if adding the extra back slash does not work, separating the LaTeX elements into different strings and then applying concatenation might fix the problem.

### Storing and displaying answers with LaTeX elements

Let's assume that we have two variables ```t1``` and ```t2```  which are used to generate different answers each time a new variant of a question is created.  The answers need to look like this: $\Delta_{v_{ t1 \to t2}}$.

For example, if we had ```t1 = 3``` and ```t2 = 5```, the answer option would be $\Delta_{v_{ 3 \to 5}}$.

Instead of using

```r"$\Delta v_{" + str(t1) + r"\to" + str(t2) + r"}$"```
to create the answer string, a combination of f-strings and raw-strings can be used to simplify the expression and to increase readability:
``` rf"$\Delta v_{{ {t1} \to {t2} }}$" ```

The variables need to be enclosed by a set of curly braces. In addition, the curly braces needed by LaTeX need to be doubled to 'escape' them.
